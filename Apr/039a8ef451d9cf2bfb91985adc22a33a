SENIOR officers from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) are attending a workshop on Satellite Communications Regulations taking place at the headquarters of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO).
A forward-looking national communications regulatory framework is essential for delivering the benefits of broadband technology to the people of Nigeria, and so NCC requested the CTO to organise the workshop to enable NCC officers to better regulate the provision of satellites services in their country.
Executive commissioner, Technical Services at the NCC Engr Ubale Maska said: “It is the role of regulators, such as the NCC, to encourage the deployment of all types of technologies for the growth of a robust ICT infrastructure. We thank the CTO for organising this workshop to better enable NCC regulate access to satellites and so grow access to broadband for Nigerian citizens and businesses.”

Secretary-General of the CTO, Mr Shola Taylor who moderated the workshop said: “The CTO is committed to promoting enabling regulatory environments for ICTs across the Commonwealth. We are pleased to have the opportunity to assist our Nigerian colleagues in their role in regulating satellite communications in Nigeria and look forward to working with them further on this in the future.”
Sessions on the filing and authorisation process for satellite space and ground segments, including a hands-on experience of the filling process were delivered by Chuen Chern Loo of the International Telecommunication Union.
Other areas explained include the role of the regulator, the elaboration of a national satellite communications regulatory framework and the use of Earth Stations in Motion.
