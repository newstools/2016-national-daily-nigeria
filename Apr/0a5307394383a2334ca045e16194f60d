A former member of the Kogi State House of Assembly and former Caretaker Chairman, Ogori/Magongo Local Government Area of the state, Gabriel Daudu has been sentence to 154 years in prison for a N1.4 billion fraud.
Securing the conviction on Monday at the Federal High Court, Lokoja, Kogi state, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), first arraigned the convict in April 2010, on a-208 count charge bordering on money laundering and misappropriation of public funds.
Justice Inyang Ekwo, who presided over the case at a Federal High Court in Lokoja, Kogi State, found him guilty of 77 counts and sentenced him to 154 years imprisonment.
In his ruling, the trial judge, held that the prosecution proved its case beyond every reasonable doubt, and therefore sentenced Daudu to two years on each of the 77 counts to run concurrently.

Before the conviction of Daudu, prosecuting counsel, Wahab Shittu, tendered various exhibits before the court and fielded 13 witnesses to prove the case against him.
It would be recalled that in the course of the trial presided over by Justice Ekwo, had indicated that the trial might have to start afresh as the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Ibrahim Auta, had asked Justice P.M. Ayuba of the Lokoja Division of the court to take over the case.
However, Shittu had pleaded with Justice Auta to review the decision. The Chief Judge, thereafter, returned the case file to Justice Ekwo, who has now found Daudu guilty of the 77 counts.
