The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation, NDIC, has called on depositors of liquidated banks in Enugu State to come forward and claim their money.
A breakdown showed unclaimed depositors’ fund of N17.02m from three micro finance banks, as well as N43.68m for depositors in the closed Havard Trust Savings and Loans. Managing Director/ Chief Executive of NDIC, Umaru Ibrahim, made the call at the ongoing 27th Enugu International Trade Fair.
Ibrahim, who was represented by Mr. Nicholas Ayuba Ibrahim, urged depositors who have funds in liquidated banks “to endeavour to file their claims with the corporation for immediate payment.”
“I wish to use this opportunity to call on depositors of the three MFBs here in Enugu, whose licences were revoked recently to, as a matter of urgency, come forward and file claims for payment of their deposits.

“Of the total insured deposit, amounting to N75.49 million for the three MFBs, N58.47m has been paid, leaving a balance of N17.02m.
“Furthermore, depositors of the closed Havard Trust Savings and Loans, also in Enugu, are advised to file their claims as N37.96m only has been paid to some of them to date out of the insured sum of N81.64m, leaving an outstanding balance of N43.68m.”
The NDIC boss equally cautioned Nigerians against patronising ‘wonder banks,’ which he said “offer mouthwatering interest rates to dupe unsuspecting members of the public of their hard earned incomes in the name of investments.
