Local Government Administration in Lagos State has been given a new lease of live, as the state legislature concludes amendment process on the existing law meant for its smooth running.
A bill to amend the Lagos state local government administration law, scaled the last hurdle yesterday after the third reading on the floor, and by implication the conduct of council election seem nearer.
Sequel to the procedural laying of report by chairman of the committee on local government administration and community affairs, Hon. Kazeem Alimi; the House took the presentation of the report and the third reading and subsequently passed it into law. It now awaits Governor Akinwunmi Ambode’s assent.
Consequentially the law is now titled, ‘The Local Government (Administration) (Amendment) Law 2016’.
