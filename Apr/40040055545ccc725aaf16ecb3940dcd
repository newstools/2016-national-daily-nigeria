Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has called on Magistrates  across the country  to be fearless and firm in their dispensation  of justice.

Speaking when he granted  audience to the Members of the National Executive Committee of the Magistrates Association of Nigeria, Governor  Wike  said  that  the  functions of Magistrates  remain  vital to  the  dispensation  of justice in the country.

He urged Magistrates to stop the practice of returning  case files on the basis that they are afraid of the antics of certain  interests and those who  will malign them after delivering  judgment.

He said: “judicial officers should not abdicate their responsibilities because  they are afraid  of  petitions. If everyone throws in the towel, who will dispense justice?”
