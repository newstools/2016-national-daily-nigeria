Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will return to football management as he has been confirmed as England coach to the 2016 Soccer Aid match, although he will manage the team for just one game.
According to Goal, the ex-Chelsea boss will be assisted by Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce and singer Robbie Williams during the game. The Portuguese born tactician will play against a ‘Rest of the World’ side tutored by current Leicester City coach Claudio Ranieri. “I want to be the first one to win the Soccer Aid trophy for both teams, England and the Rest of the World,” said Mourinho, who won the match with the global side in 2014. “Sam and I will make a very good partnership and it will be a great feeling for Claudio to finally lose a match! I hope the organisers can help me now with an English passport,” he chuckled. Meanwhile, there are reports that Mourinho is in talks with Paris Saint-Germaine for a permanent coaching deal.
The Parc des Princes club have already tied up the French elite league title and are in contention to win both the Coupe de la Ligue and Coupe de France this season, although their main aim was progression past the Champions League quarter-finals. Also, the Special One has also been rumored to have signed a 3-year-deal with Manchester United, but the 53-year-old, has denied putting pen on paper for any club, adding that Louis Van Gaal is a friend to him. “Van Gaal is my friend, I worked with him for a few years. I am always linked with jobs and in the summer I will have a job, but in this moment I can promise you I do not have a contract with any club. I am not in a position to turn jobs down; I am in a position to analyse. I am in a position to be open to any club or national team,” Mourinho said. The manager has however told Manchester United to appoint him before May 1, 2016, or risk losing him.
