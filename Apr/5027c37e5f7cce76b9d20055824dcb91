THE Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has expressed concern over multiple taxations imposed on telecommunications firms in Nigeria.
The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Garba Umaru, made the observation in a message to the Special Day of the commission at the ongoing 27th Enugu International Trade Fair in Enugu on Friday, April 1.
Umaru said the service providers are suffering untold hardship in the country as a result of imposition of taxes and levies.
“Apart from the taxes and levies, the service providers are further burdened with regulations that restrict right of way to deploy or expand services.

“Even when the service providers are willing to make services available, we as members of government at various levels and communities put bottlenecks on their way.
He said that for the service providers to make services available to consumers, they have to build base stations, masts, towers, which were challenges they faced.
The NCC boss said that the commission had continued to engage states in the South-East to discourage multiple taxations and regulations.
Umaru expressed regrets that vandalising telecom infrastructure was very high in the South-East of the country which also contributed to the challenges faced by service providers.
