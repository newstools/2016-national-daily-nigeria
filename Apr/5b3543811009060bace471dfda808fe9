The Nigerian Senate appears to be on truce-making missions as it suspends many of its proposed amendments, including that of CCT/CCB Act, and the Administration of Criminal Justice Act aimed at giving Sen. President Bukola Saraki a soft landing in his on-going trial at the CCT.
The upper chamber also suspended the disciplinary action the Ethics Committee recommended for Sen. Kabiru Marafa, an anti-Saraki lawmaker, the committee indicted for speaking in a manner that undermined the integrity of the National Assembly.
There was also a resolution to drop all court cases against members, and to harmonise the warring factions in the upper chamber so the eighth Senate will be able to move forward.
After a nine-month-long cloak-and-dagger law-making, the senators decided to kiss and make up  at end of a closed door session on Wednesday.

Since the inauguration of the eighth assembly, the Senate has been shattered into splinters comprising mainly the Senate Unity Forum led by Sen. Ahmed Lawan, and the Like Minded Senators loyal to Saraki.
The lawmakers had on April 14 introduced a bill for an amendment of the Code of Conduct Tribunal and Bureau Act, rushing it through second reading just 48 hours after it was first read.
Sponsored by Peter Nwaoboshi (PDP-Delta State), the bill tore through its second reading and was later referred to the committees on Judiciary and Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions.
The proposed amendments drew criticism from many Nigerians who perceived the proposals as aiding corruption among the federal lawmakers. The senate action became more suspect because it came on the heels of an appellate court’s judgement ordering Saraki to submit himself for trial at the CCT.
Saraki had appealed the sixth time to stop his trial after the Supreme Court gave a similar verdict.
