Finally, in line with the Federal Government’s commitment in its war against insurgency in the North East, to rehabilitate and reintegrate Boko Haram members that surrendered and genuinely repented, the Defence Headquarters has established a rehabilitation camp known as Operation SAFE CORRIDOR.
The Director, Defence Information, (DDI) said in Abuja Tuesday that the focus of Operation SAFE CORRIDOR was geared towards rehabilitating, reintegrating the repentant and the surrendered Boko Haram members back to the normal life in the society.
He added, “The repentant terrorists in the Camp would be taken through various vocational training so that they could be useful to themselves and be empowered to contribute meaningfully to the economic growth of their fatherland.
The Defence Headquarters, therefore, appealed to other recalcitrant terrorist members that are still carrying arms against the nation and its citizens to repent in order to benefit from numerous opportunities offered by the Camp.

It, however, warned that those who refused to surrender and embrace this opportunity granted by the federal government, the DHQ continue its final onslaught against the remnant group of the terrorists unabated and would not relent until the power of evil forces in the North East is completely neutralized.
“The reluctant Boko Haram members should therefore see wisdom in surrendering now, thereby saving themselves from imminent calamity that is about to fall on them, in the event of military mop-up if they continue in their unwholesome acts,” Gen Abubakar reiterated.
He urged the public to be extra vigilant and report any unusual persons, objects and movement to the security agencies for prompt action.
