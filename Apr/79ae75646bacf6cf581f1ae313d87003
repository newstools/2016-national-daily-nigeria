A total of 19 candidates are jostling for the Vice-Chancellorship seat of the University of Jos, an official has confirmed. Mr. Abdullahi Abdullahi, the institution’s Assistant Registrar (Information and Public Relations), told reporters in Jos on Tuesday that the eventual appointee would replace Prof. Hayward Mafuyai, whose tenure would end in June.
“Nineteen professors applied for the job. The screening by the selection committee started last week,” he said.
According to him, the selection board will recommend three of the candidates to the university’s governing board. Abdullahi told reporters that majority of the applicants were from the university community, while others were from other institutions. The job was advertised in December 2015.
