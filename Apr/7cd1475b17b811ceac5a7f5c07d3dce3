GENERATION Jesus, the youth branch of the Redeemed Church of God on the Island, and its Divine Peace team recently organized a football competition for other parishes to bring the youth together.
Kingsley Nnamdi, one of the coordinators of Daniel Generation Youth Church (DG Soccer team ), told National Daily sports that the competition was between six RCCG parishes, and was meant to bring together all youth to start working together and be open to each other irrespective of their of their parishes. It was also a platform to evangelise the youth.
Kingsley said Daniel Generation Youth Ministry of R.C.C.G, Olive Tree Parish, lost the game, and wasn’t happy about how they were trashed by Divine Peace.
The DG’s coordinator explained that although his team lost out 2-0 to Generation Jesus Parish, it’s was all fun and in good spirits. He wished his team better luck next time as this was the first of its kind by RCCG.
