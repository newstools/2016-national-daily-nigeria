The Chairman of the agency, Mr. Kalejaiye Paul made this disclosure, while playing host to the House Committee on Transport,which paid a constitutional oversight visit to their Obalende office.
The Ferry Services boss noted that they encountered challenges,he added that he just assumed office a month ago and that the major problem facing the agency is fund.
