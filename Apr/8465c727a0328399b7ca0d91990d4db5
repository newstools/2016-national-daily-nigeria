ENUGU Rangers are riding high in the league but all is not as rosy as it seems according to first team player, Aguda Godwin.
The league leaders are yet to receive salaries this season and while team solidarity has seen them come this far, Aguda maintains that the lack of communication from the club Management could have huge implications on the steady progress of the team.
The Flying Antelopes are top on the log with 17 points from 9 matches as they look to end a Three decade trophy-less streak.
