THE Federal Government has urged Muslims to respect constituted authorities in order to promote national security, stability and cohesion.
Minister of Information Alhaji Lai Mohammed gave the advice at the Abuja National Mosque during a two-day conference on “Promoting National Stability Through Constructive Social Relations with Constituted Authority” organized by the Zaymar Islamic Research and Development Education Centre.
The minister said Muslims, irrespective of their sect, must respect and be loyal to constituted authority in the country.
“The Holy Qur’an and the Prophet Muhammad harp on the need for believers to obey, remain loyal and to recognize and acknowledge the authority of those who preside over their affairs, particularly their Muslim leaders. We should treat them with utmost respect and desist from being confrontational to them,” Mohammed said.

He warned that a deviation from this advice will only spell further doom over and above what the country is currently experiencing.
Meanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff Major-General Tukur Yusuf Buratai and Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas assured Nigerians of security and respect for human rights.
National Coordinator of Zaymar Hajiya Shifa Garba said the conference was among others meant to bridge the gap and cement existing relationship between the citizens and the leaders across the country.
