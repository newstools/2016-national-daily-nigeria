THE Zazzau Emirate Development Association (ZEDA) on Monday testified against the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), otherwise known as the Shiite sect, saying that the movement terrorised the emirate for years.
Spokesman of ZEDA, Mohammed Balarabe, made the allegation while appearing before the judicial commission of inquiry sitting in Kaduna.
Balarabe narrated how the movement terrorized the emirate community when he said the movement took laws into their hands and shut down the roads while holding it procession.
He said whenever the movement was having its outing they (people of Zaria emirate) do not go out and are forced to stay indoors.
He said the December 12, 2015 clash between the members of the Shiites and the Nigerian Army is not the first time while alleging that the group is violent.
He cited instances where the group had encounters with the Emir of Zaria, Alhaji Shehu Idris and former governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero while also recalling that the movements had series of encounters with previous government administrations.

Balarabe was also quick to say the leader, Sheikh El-Zakzaky, and the Shiite sect are not it members of ZEDA, saying they refused to register with the Emirate association.
According to him, “We are familiar with the movement actions for 20 years of existence. And as someone who schooled in Ahmadu Bello University, ABU, Zaria, we know where the shoe pinches.
“Whenever we heard they have outing we stay away because it will bring untold hardship on the people. They shut the road. They have outings on Thursday and we shun the roads to avoid confrontations.
“It’s not their first time; they have done it to the Emir of Zaria, Dr. Shehu Idris and former Governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero when he was to visit a sick friend in the hospital.”
