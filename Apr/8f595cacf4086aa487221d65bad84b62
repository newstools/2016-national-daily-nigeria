FORMER International, Tijani Babangida has lampooned the NFF Technical Committee, pointing fingers at the department for its incompetence and redundancy as the bane of the country’s national teams.
Babangida’s comments come on the heels of the vacant Super Eagles Coaching job. The Nff had hired three Coaches to execute the countries Afcon 2017 qualifiers, though the country had gone on to miss out on a ticket for the competition.
In a media parley, the former Eagles Liaison officer said the committee did not support coaches nor carried out their duties. He also expressed his disgust at the way the NFF happily pull the trigger on coaches.
