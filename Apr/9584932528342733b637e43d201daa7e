According to report, the problem started at 12:45 pm, as the angry youths barricaded as they insisted on seeing the state Governor Samuel Ortom, before they will leave the scene.


The Secretary to the state government, Mr. Tagema Takema however addressed the angry youths but they refused to shift ground unless the governor comes in person.
