Tobun told reporters in Lagos that the government had reconstructed collapsed drains and repaired many roads to cope with the flood waters.
“The Lagos State Government is proactive and ever ready. It is the vision of the state government to ensure that residents are adequately taken care of and that they face little or no challenge during rainy season.
“All hands are on deck, and currently, the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure is fixing collapsed drains, while the Ministry of Environment is also doing all round de-silting of the waterways and dredging the channels.

“So, we are ready, most of those roads that are not motorable are now being rehabilitated, while some were being patched by the State Public Works Corporation,” he said.
The lawmaker said the corporation in collaboration with other state agencies were making efforts to ensure a hitch-free season.
On the ongoing repair of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway by the state government, Tobun said the contractor had completed 50 per cent of the job.
He added: “Lagos State Government being a very responsive one heard the cry of the people on the poor state of the federal road which has been abandoned.
