The Nigerian Army on Thursday in Abuja disassociates itself from the activities of individuals and groups who are engaging in solidarity rallies for the routing and decimation of Boko Haram insurgents in the North east.
It says that despite thanking them for expressing their concern, they also want to state that such rallies could also be distractive to the force.
In a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Col. Sani Kukasheka Usman said the public should not be deceived by the terrorist as “the terrorists are surreptitiously fanning out of their last enclaves in Sambisa want to cause havoc or seek refuge elsewhere.

He cautioned citizens to be vigilant and security conscious to enable us clear the remnants of the terrorists wherever they might flee. He reassures the public that the military would remain professional and focused in clearing the remnants of the criminals on the Nigerian soil.
He said, “The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a number of groups and individuals celebrating the routing out and decimation of Boko Haram terrorists on our soil. So much as we thank them for that, it is imperative to state that we do not begrudge such persons their desire to identify and associate themselves with this success.
“However, the Nigerian Army wishes to disassociate itself from such celebrations and solidarity rallies. We also would like to advice that they should tread with caution as this could be distraction to us,” he added.
