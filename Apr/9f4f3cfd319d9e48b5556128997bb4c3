In an effort to further strengthen the relationship that Lagos State government and Akwaaba have enjoyed over the years, the Akwaaba African Travel Market team, led by Mrs. Rita Ikechi-Uko, recently paid a courtesy visit to the Lagos State Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture at the Lagos State Government secretariat, Alausa, Lagos State.
The team was received by the Honourable Commissioner, Mr. Folorunsho Folarin-Coker.  While interacting with the Akwaaba team, Coker explained that he has a passion to see that more ‘Lagosians’ consume more of the tourism products of Lagos. And that this he would do by engaging meaningful platforms that would stimulate that response from the inhabitants of Lagos.
