…as UBA, others outperform market
By Odunewu Segun
Ecobank, Union Bank, FCMB, Wema Bank and Fidelity Bank led in profit losses in the sector due to the economic crisis in in the country.
According to the Banks 2015 annual financial results released in March, the five banks posted a combined 80 per cent decline in profits, their profit before tax tumbled by 69 per cent to N77.65bn from N131.19bn in 2014.
Similarly, the combined profit after tax of the five banks fell from N107.279bn in 2014 to N59.73bn in 2015, indicating a decline of 79.59 per cent.
The N53.54bn fall in profit was attributed by many of the banks’ chief executive officers to high impairment charges on bad loans, foreign exchange volatility and other challenges facing the economy following the significant drop in the nation’s oil revenue due to the sharp fall in oil prices.
Of the 10 banks that released their results, five posted sharp decline in profits, a major departure from the consistent rise in profits posted by almost all the banks in the country after the 2010 banking crisis.
The reports on the NSE website showed that Ecobank posted a PBT of N40bn in the 2015 financial year; Union Bank, N18.1bn; FCMB, N2.5bn; Fidelity Bank, N14bn; and Wema Bank, N3.046bn.
However, the five other banks that released their 2015 annual reports in March this year outperformed the market, posting increases in both their profit before tax and profit after tax. This is despite the huge provisions for bad loans that most of them made in the 2015 financial year.
