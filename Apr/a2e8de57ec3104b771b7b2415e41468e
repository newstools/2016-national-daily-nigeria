The Commissioner for Transport in Lagos State, Hon. Dayo Mobereola and the Special Adviser of the Ministry, Prince (Hon.) Anofi Elegushi on Monday tactically ignored the members of the State House of Assembly Committee, which had gone to the ministry on oversight function.
According to reports, the Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Fatai Mojeed and the legislative staff attached to him, had arranged with the Commissioner for official visit to the ministry, which is part of their oversight function.
It was gathered that the Chairman of the Committee was accompanied on the visit by other members of the committee including Hon. Olanrewaju Ogunyemi and Hon. Jude Idimogu.

The committee members reportedly arrived the Ministry around 10:45am and were kept waiting for about 30 minutes inside their bus at the entrance of the ministry.
A source stated that the Special Adviser was in his office and yet did not go downstairs to receive the visiting lawmakers, while the Commissioner was yet to arrive his office though he was said to be aware of the visit.
The Commissioner, we gathered, might be avoiding the lawmakers because of their earlier visit to the office of the Lagos Area Metropolitan Transport Authority (LAMATA), where they insisted on seeing the 13-year records of the parastatal.
