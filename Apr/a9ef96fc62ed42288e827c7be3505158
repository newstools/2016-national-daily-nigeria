After collecting N23 million of the taxpayers’ N2.5 billion Esther Nenadi Usman stashed into her company’s account to fund former President Goodluck Jonathan’s re-election, the EFCC has also taken over two Abuja houses belonging to the ex-minister.
Nenadi was the finance director of the PDP Campaign Organisation—the body that received the fund taken from the Central Bank of Nigeria in the lead-up to the 2015 general elections.
She arrived the country last week after months of EFCC’s investigations uncovering misappropriation of $2.1 billion by former NSA Sambo Dasuki.
Nenadi’s share was said to be part of it.

According to her, the PDP asked her as finance director to open an account for the campaign organisation. And she had to use her company Joint Trust Dimension Ltd to do that.
It was from there she shared out the money to others, including Femi Fani-Kayode, ex-Gov. Achike Udenwa, SDP leader Olu Falae, among others.
Nenadi, however, said there was no way she could have known the money was taken from the CBN.
That’s the same narrative Fani-Kayode, Falae, and others have given.
For now, the anti-graft body has yet to invite others connected with the N2.5 billion scam. But many believe Nenadi’s arrest would pave the way for others.
