Imama Amapakabo and Chisom Egbuchulam of Enugu Rangers have been named the League Bloggers Awards (LBA) Manager and Player respectively for the March in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).
Rangers coach, Amapakabo, emerged winner in the manager’s category by beating the trio of Mohammed Baba Ganaru of Kano Pillars, Mitko Dobrev of FC Ifeanyiubah and Abdul Maikaba of Wikki Tourists.
Amapakabo guided his side to claim 11 points in the month under review despite suffering a loss to Lobi Stars. Rangers secured home wins over Wikki Tourists, Akwa United and Enyimba and mixed it up with two away draws at Abia Warriors and Warri Wolves.

Only Wikki coach, Maikaba, came close to knocking off Amapakabo as his team also got 11 points but fell short when both men came head-to-head on March 5 when Godwin Aguda’s goal settled matters at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in Enugu.
In the player’s category, the race was trimmed to three players, Egbuchulam, Anthony Okpotu of Lobi Stars and El-Kanemi’s Ibrahim Mustapha, who appeared to be neck in neck in terms of performance for the month of March.
