THE Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Prof Garba Umar Danbatta has said that the universal service provision fund (USPF) will play a significant role in achieving four out of the eight point agenda of the commission.
Danbatta who was speaking at the USPF focused industry stakeholders forum in Lagos said USPF will be used to facilitate broadband penetration services by promoting deployment of universally available fast and reliable network infrastructure that will stimulate seamless broadband penetration to drive technology innovations and overall productivity of the economy.
“The USPF infrastructure projects have been designed to deepen broadband penetration in the unserved and underserved areas.”
He further stated that there will be facilitation of active infrastructure sharing amongst telecommunications operators that will encourage seamless adoption of next generation technologies and remove all barriers for smooth operations.
Danbatta said the two fund guiding principles are co-location/infrastructure sharing and quality of service.
“The implementations of infrastructure projects are predicated on encouraging infrastructure sharing with the aim of improving cost and quality efficiency”.
