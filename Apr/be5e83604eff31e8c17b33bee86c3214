As the trial of Sen. President Bukola Saraki entered its second day Wednesday, the Code of Conduct Bureau prosecution’s witness, Michael Watkas, revealed how the senator had been drawing salaries and pension from the Kwara government since 20111 until August last year.
Earlier in the trial, Wetkas said Saraki also wired $3.4 million to his America Express card shortly after he left office as governor for eight years

“Exhibit 15 is the statement of Saraki’s salary account with Intercontinental Bank. N254,412.25 was the salary for July 2007.
“In May, 2011, salary paid on June 3, 2011 was N291,124. The narration reads: KWSG May, 2011 salary.

The witness also gave a breakdown of three accounts, each in naira, dollar and pounds sterling, operated by Saraki while he was governor of Kwara State.
Saraki was the sole signatory to the accounts which were with the Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, according to the witness.
Those inflows were sourced mainly from loans from GTB, which were defrayed by cash lodgements by various individuals, including bank officials, his personal aides and other unnamed persons.
He said Saraki spent the monies on acquisition of landed assets from the Presidential Implementation Committee on Federal Government Properties and the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Wetkas also revealed that there were multiple lodgements as high as 87 transactions in one day  in order to circumvent the cash transaction threshold provided for by the money laundering law.
