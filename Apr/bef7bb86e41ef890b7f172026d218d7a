NATCOM Development and Investment Limited (trading as ‘Ntel’), would on April 8 commence commercial sales of its 0804 mobile line in Lagos and Abuja.
Ntel recently made its first Voice over LTE call in Lagos. The test VoLTE call was made at Ntel’s new Tier III data centre located on Lagos Island.
Mr. Kamar Abass, CEO   while announcing the rollout plan , said Ntel would begin the first phase rollout with the commercial sales of its 0804 mobile line on April 8 in Lagos and Abuja.
He said although the company acquired some base transceiver stations (BTS) from the old NITEL, it also entered partnership agreement with IHS and Helios Towers, builders of BTS and other telecoms infrastructure, to roll out 600 base stations for the commercial rollout in Lagos and Abuja, with plans to extend the rollout plan to Port Harcourt with additional 200 BTS, also known as base stations.

The CEO of ntel also added that ntel had deployed LTE Advanced, the latest 4G technology with multi-antennae sites.
