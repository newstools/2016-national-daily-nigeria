From EMMA ANYA, Abakaliki
VICE-President Yemi Osinbajo has described the late mother of Ebonyi State Governor, Deaconess Margaret Umahi, as a “Christian icon and a great mother of the state.”
Speaking at the Osborn La-palm Hotel Event Centre, Agu-Ugwu Umunaga, Uburu in Ohaozara Local Government Area during a thanksgiving service in honour of Deaconess Umahi, Osinbajo noted that the deceased was being celebrated for living a very useful life in the service of God and humanity.
He said he would not be among those praying for the repose of the soul of the governor’s mother because he was sure that she was already resting in the bosom of the Lord.
Osinbajo, who disclosed that he had always found the contributions of Governor David Nweze Umahi during National Economic Council meetings very useful and “progressive,” expressed confidence that “this (Ebonyi) state would prosper under the leadership of Engr. David Umahi”.
He appealed to all privileged Nigerians to use their natural endowments to affect the lives of others positively in the society.
