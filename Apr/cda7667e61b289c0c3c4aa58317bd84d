When the parliament passed the budget last week, President Muhammadu Buhari declined to assent the bill, demanding to see the details before signing.
President Muhammadu Buhari presented the 2016 national budget before a joint session of the National Assembly, comprising the Senate and the House of Representatives on December 22, 2015. Since then, there have been controversies surrounding the authenticity of the budget submitted, which has dragged on for a while.
