THE Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, has said it is expecting over 650,000 barrels per day of crude to be refined locally after nine companies submitted their bids for the co-location of refineries.
In a statement signed by Mr. GarbaDeen Muhammad, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, in Abuja, the NNPC said it was committed to boosting the nation’s refining capacity which in turn would put an end to perennial fuel scarcity in the country.
Meanwhile, nine companies have submitted their bids to participate in the co-location of refineries to ensure greater output.
The Chief Operating Officer, Refineries, NNPC, Mr. AniboKragha, disclosed this at the opening of the technical bids for the location of new refineries within the existing plants at the corporation’s headquarters in Abuja.
He said the bidding was a demonstration of the determination of the government and the NNPC to increase the nation’s crude oil refining capacity from 445,000 barrels per day to 650,000bpd.

“The aim is to leverage on the existing facilities to fast-track the take-off of the refineries as soon as possible,” the COO said in a statement issued by the oil firm.
According to him, a technical evaluation committee has been set up to study the bids and will announce the winners as soon as possible.
The General Manager, Supply Chain Management, NNPC, Sophia Mbakwe, enjoined all the bidders to accept the outcome as the process would be transparent.
She stressed that all the rules of public procurement as spelt out in the Bureau for Public Procurement Act would be strictly adhered to.
