Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly have congratulated the All Progressive Congress APC Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his recent birthday.
Hon. Tunde Braimoh who represents Kosofe II, described the Asiwaju as a man of honour, well-respected, selfless, forgiving and a man of impeccable character.
Contributing, Hon. Rotimi Olowo said nobody could unravel the misery around Asiwaju because he remained a problem solver.
Hon. Sanai Agunbiade reiterated that Asiwaju is known for three things which according to him are because: he works on conviction rather than sentiment; he study people to identify the leadership traits and talent in them to produce a good leader and he rewards loyalty and commitment.
 He further thanked God for giving Asiwaju as a leader for the country.
In his remark, the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa said “it is good to celebrate ourselves when we are alive because Asiwaju is a selfless leader; a leader who is making and building other leaders.

May Almighty Allah continue to be with him, protect and guide him,” he stated.
 In another development, the lawmakers also commiserated with the family of Braithwaite over the demise of their son Dr. Olatunji Braithwaite.
