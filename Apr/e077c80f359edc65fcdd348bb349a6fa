Apart from the 13-count charge Sen. President Bukola Saraki is wrestling with before the Code of Conduct Tribunal in Abuja, the Code of Conduct Bureau will be slamming him with two more charges—including double-dipping—as it amends the initial charges.
As a senator, Saraki, according to prosecution’s witness, was still drawing governor salaries from Kwara from 2011 until 2013, while he earned his pay at the Senate, too.
The offence runs afoul of section 6(a) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act. CAP. C15, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 and as incorporated under paragraph 2(a), Part I of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution.
It is punishable under section 23(2) of the CCB/CCT Act as incorporated under paragraph 18, Part I of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution.
According to Sahara Reporters, the second of the fresh charges is Saraki’s failure to declare his leasehold interest in a property located 42, Remi Fani-Kayode Street, Ikeja, Lagos when he became governor.

He acquired the property on December 12, 1996, through his company, Skyview Properties Limited from First Finance Trust Limited.
The offence is said to be contrary to section 15(1)(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, CAP. C15, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 and as incorporated under paragraph 11(1) and (2), Part I o the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution.
It is punishable under section 23(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act as incorporated under paragraph 18, Part I of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution.
The amended charges will be read to him when trial resumes on April 27.
Thursday was the fourth day of the on-going trial of the Senate president over false asset declaration when he was Kwara’s governor for eight years.
His efforts to scuttle the trial in the last eight months have failed so far.
