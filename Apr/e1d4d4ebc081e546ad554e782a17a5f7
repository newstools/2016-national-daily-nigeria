THE total blackout experienced in some part of the country last week has been blamed on more than three hours of zero power generation from all the power plants in the country.
Announcing the return to normalcy, the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola said Nigeria’s power generation which collapsed completely has been restored back to normalcy.
Speaking in Abuja, Fashola explained that the collapse was induced by a sudden downing of the three turbines at the Jebba Hydro Power Station. He noted that the turbines were quickly restarted and power generation then began to grow back.
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Electricity System Operator, an arm of the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, said it transmitted 2,905.70 megawatts (Mw) to the 11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) across the country.
Estimates obtained on the operator’s website showed it released 435.86Mw to Ikeja, 334.16Mw to Abuja, 319.65Mw to Eko, 261.51Mw to Benin, 261.51Mw to Enugu, as Ibadan received 377.74, and Jos got 159.81Mw.

It also allocated 232.46Mw to Kano, 232.46 to Kaduna, 188.87 to Port Harcourt, and 101.70Mw to Yola.
It further noted that it attained a peak generation of 3778.90Mw, low generation of 3,305.80Mw, adding that its highest frequency was 51.28 Hz while lowest frequency was 48.83Hz.
The Head of Public Relations and Media at Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Ahmed Shekarau confirmed the allocation, noting that the firm does not only exhaust all its allocation but it also exceeds it.
According to him, “We (Abuja Disco) distribute everything. Everyday, we distribute more than what is allocated to us.”
In a system report data for yesterday, the System Operator allocated a Multi-Year Tariff Order Load of 352.02Mw to the ADEC while it distributed an average of 509.36Mw.
The difference between the actual average distribution and the allocation was 157.33Mw while it forecast an average distribution of 399.76 for today.
