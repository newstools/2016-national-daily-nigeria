THE Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Professor Umar Garba Danbatta has described as not acceptable that broadband penetration in the country rose by four per cent to 10 per cent in 2015.
Danbatta, who address stakeholders’ forum recently on the consultancy study on the determination of cost-based pricing on fixed transmission services, said the growth of broadband penetration by four per cent in 2015 was not good enough, given the plan of the country to raise it to 30 per cent the year 2018.
He said, “Statistical report by the International Telecommunications Union indicated that broadband penetration rate in the country is low and stood at six per cent and 10 per cent respectively for 2014 and 2015.

The Nigeria communication commission acknowledged this low penetration rates and put in place the modalities to increase the penetration rate from six per cent to 30 per cent by 2018.
“One of the major steps to do this is to encourage massive infrastructure build out that will stimulate seamless broadband penetration to drive technology innovations and overall productivity of the economy.”
The NCC boss state, “The commission did a study on the assessment of the current level of competition in the telecommunications industry. On conclusion of that study, it was obvious that the pricing of transmission leased lines was discriminatory and arbitrary thus, forming the basis of the case study to determine the pricing in this market.”
