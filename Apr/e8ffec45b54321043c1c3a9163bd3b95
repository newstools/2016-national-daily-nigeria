Abubakar said Sterling Bank is committed to best practice in risk management. “This informs why we have continued to fortify our Risk Management team and provide adequate training programmes to ensure that they are up-to-date in current risk management practices worldwide.”
He said the award would serve as a morale booster for the bank to further improve its risk management processes and sustain its leadership position; adding that the award was based on the bank’s risk management practices and the entrenchment of a risk management culture within the bank.
Sterling Bank defeated several other banks, Insurance companies and other players in the financial services sector to clinch the award.
