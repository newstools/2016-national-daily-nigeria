WITH a sexy voice, hit songs and buzzing collabo with Falz on the song ‘Soldier’, female singer, Simi has successfully placed herself in the consciousness of many music lovers in the country. Just recently we heard that Peter Okoye of Psquare is also interested in signing her to his record label.
In a recent interview, Simi who is signed on to X3M music says ‘If I am going to have a collaboration with anyone in Nigeria, for Fuji, it will definitely be Pasuma Wonder while for Juju, it will be Ebenezer Obey because I actually fantasise about doing a song with him because he is a living legend as well as King Sunny Ade’.
Asked if her new found fame has changed anything about her, she said, ‘Well, this is the real me that can still stop by and buy roasted plantain by the road side; I don’t feel uncomfortable, I am not blown away by fame because that is not what excites me, what excites me is the music. I am happy about my celebrity status only because more people know my music and want to relate with it’.
