Mr. Rabiu Olalekan, whose known address as at the time of arrest was C135, Bere – Mapo, Ibadan, Oyo State, confessed to have been doing the business of re-packaging expired digestive biscuits and selling them to members of the public at a cheaper rate with Mr. Hakeem Tiamiyu who lives at No 26, Oremeji Street, Ikotun – Egbe, Lagos.

He explained that the suspects claimed they purchased hundreds of packs of the digestive biscuit before the demolition of Mosafejo market which prompted the changing of expiring date and re – packaging since they were unable to dispose of the said items before expiry.
