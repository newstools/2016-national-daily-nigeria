During the visit at the Customs Headquarters in Abuja, the IGP underscored the fact that Police partnership with other security agencies always made the tasks of crime control and management much easier in the country.
The IGP used the opportunity of the visit to inform the Comptroller-General of the establishment of Joint Control Centre (JCC) at the Police Headquarters, Abuja which, according to him, will serve as a platform for other sister security agencies to engender cooperation in operational areas.
