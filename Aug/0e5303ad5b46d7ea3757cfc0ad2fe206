Aero Contractors financial crisis deepened at the weekend as the once largest domestic airlines is set to lay off some of its staff over operational challenges that has led to the closure of some its stations.
National Daily gathered that airline met with officials of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria over the matter at the weekend. It was also gathered that the airline had not been able to bring in some of its airplanes that were sent out for routine maintenance due to foreign exchange constraints.
President of ATSSSAN, Mr. Benjamin Okewu said the Union was negotiating redundancy with airline, and not that it is closing down. “So, we are in the process of concluding redundancy negotiations for them to send some people out. But that does not mean they are closing down completely because Aero has two segments”

He stressed that virtually all domestic airlines in Nigeria were being confronted with problems, ranging from double taxation by government agencies in the sector, scarcity of aviation fuel and difficulty in accessing forex.
Speaking the operational crisis, Okewu said the takeover of Aero by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has been affecting the operations of the carrier, urging the government to intervene, stressing that the matter had been taken to the National Assembly.
“I will like to state here that this is not the problem of workers but a purely management issue. So, we have urged the government to intervene because the way AMCON is taking the issue is not the best method. It takes a long time before airlines break even and Aero has been going through a lot of challenges.”
