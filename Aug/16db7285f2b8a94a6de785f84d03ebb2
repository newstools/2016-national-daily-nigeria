THE Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Nigeria’s telecommunications industry regulator, has commended broadband service provider, Smile Communications Nigeria Limited for innovative services that are bound to help change the face of the nation’s telecommunications industry.
Making the commendation in Ibadan at the official opening of the Bodija Model Shop of Smile, Mr. Patrick Banji Ojo, NCC Zonal Controller at the Ibadan Zonal office, said that Smile has come to Nigeria to change the face of telecom industry.
Ojo noted that since its inception, Smile has continuously added to the competition in the industry.
“Smile is providing a more robust service through their kind of technology which is the LTE especially now that we are in the internet era. I must say that to enjoy the internet, you need data, and it must be fast and I guess that is what Smile is doing at the moment.
“What they are doing today is commendable but we want this telecom company to get closer to the people and we hope that they can get to other parts of the country as fast as they can.”

Against the background of the pervading economic recession in the country, he said that the threat of recession has nothing to do with the telecom sector as according him people must continue to make phone calls as well as make use of data in their daily businesses.
“Telecom today is like food; you just have to eat no matter how broke you may be. You have to find a way to eat. So, the same thing applies to the telecom sector, you have to find a way to communicate either through voice or data. So, people despite the harsh economic realities would have to find a way to communicate as recession is just a temporary thing and very soon if we get things right we would get out of it. We have been in and out of it before and I can assure that we would get over it”.
