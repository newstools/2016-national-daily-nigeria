A lawyer and rights activist Ugochuk­wu Osuagwu has described the accusations of impropriety levelled against the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai as diver­sionary.
Speaking with news men at the weekend in Abuja, Usuagwu said the common trend among Nigerians is to air opinions even on issues they have no facts about.
According to him, the Army chief has done no wrong buying a N48 million property in Dubai—so long as he did it legitimately, and there’s no proof he did otherwise.
He added Buratai has been declared guilty even before investigation and trial, and even some have tried to drag in the federal government into the issue.
Their action, Osuagwu said,  was a dis­traction to the anti-corrup­tion fight.

He also challenged anyone with proof of the allegations to come forward and allow the court to decide the matter.
According to him, the said property in Dubai purchased by Buratai’s wife a couple of years ago was N48 million only which is even less than what is used by private businessmen and other Nigerians to buy a three bedroom flat in high-brow areas in Abuja.
Gen. Buratai came un­der fire for acquiring two properties in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
A splinter of men and officers of the Nigerian Army—The Concerned Soldiers and Officers from the North East, had blown the whistle on Buratai, alleging that he diverted funds meant for logistics into personal use whne he was head of Army Procurement Directorate.
