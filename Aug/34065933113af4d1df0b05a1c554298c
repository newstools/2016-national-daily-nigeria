The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) says the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has fixed N150 per litre as the official depot price of kerosene.
Chairman, South-West of NUPENG, Tokunbo Korodo, stated at the weekend. He said the price will encourage more importation of the product by the marketers.
According to Korodo, most of the filling stations selling kerosene between N200 and N220 as the pump price was as a result of additional money on transportation of the product and some other levies paid by marketers.

The chairman said that at present, NNPC was the only importer of kerosene and was using private depots to sell “The NNPC has fixed N150 per litre as the new depot price of kerosene and has directed all its depots and private depot to comply with the directive.
“This did not include the transportation of the product or several levies and bank interests paid by marketers. Consequently, marketers will now add all these expenses to the depot price to arrive at N190, N200 or N220 depending on their locations.”
He said with the new price would encourage more marketers to commence importation of kerosene just like petrol.
Korodo commended the Federal Government for its transparent policy in oil and gas sector. He urged the NNPC to commence loading of its products from depots nationwide, adding that the System 2B oil pipelines were saved from being vandalised.
