“The extension of time within which to file the interim Financial Statements is necessitated for the following reasons: You will recall that the Bank sought an extension of time to file the 2015 Annual Financial Statements as a result of the delay in the annual audit due to the challenges faced with the integration with Mainstreet Bank Limited which was approved mid-2015,” it continued.
