A party organized on Kehinde Street in the Ajegunle, Lagos, was hijacked by hoodlums and cultists leading to the death of a schoolboy, Endurance Augustine.
The victim was said to have gone to the birthday party with his friends when the two groups clashed. In the process, Endurance was stabbed. Policemen from the Ajeromi division were said to have removed Endurance’s corpse and deposited it in a morgue.
An eye witness said that the hoodlums pretended to be guests at the party, fled after stabbing the victim to death.
Endurance’s mother, who did not want her name in print, said she had gone to a church service at 4pm on Wednesday only to hear the news of her son’s death on her return.

She said, “I don’t think Endurance had a quarrel with anyone before he was stabbed to death. He did not inform me that he was going to a birthday party. He was an easy-going boy. He went to school every day and ought to be in the senior school by September. I am pained that my son was murdered. I don’t even know who organised the party.”
Another resident said “Their dressing did not show good manners. In fact, some of them came to the front of my shop and smoked hemp. I warned them to stop and asked them to leave my premises, but they ignored me’’
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, confirmed the incident. She said, “Rival cults engaged each other on the streets and the police mobilised to the scene. A corpse was found and deposited at the Ajeromi General Hospital for an autopsy. Two suspects were arrested at the spot and efforts are on to arrest other fleeing suspects.”
