WHO imported pistol and bullets into the Tin Can port? This is a question which the Customs Area Comptroller (CAC), are to find answers to by holding the importer responsible for the importation.
The CAC, Comptroller Yusuf Bashar said recently that the command intercepted a reversal pistol, four bullets and two Toyota Camry.
Bashar made the disclosure in Lagos during a press interaction. He said that the pistol was discovered in a Toyota Solara a chases number 4TIFA38P4615065280 and that another Toyota Matrix with chasis number 2TILE4EF08C013249 was also intercepted along the Camry Solara.
“The Toyota Matrix was intercepted because the same importer that brought the Solara Toyota is also the same one that imported the Matrix.
“This will assist Customs for further investigation because the pistol is six round reversal type which could be dangerous.

“Customs will have handed it over to the police but the vehicles arrived on Saturday July 16 at Five Star Logistics while the terminal operators alerted Customs officers immediately they discover the pistol in the vehicle,” Bashar said.

Concluding, the CAC advised journalists to feel free and approach the command anytime they need information so that they would be able to report the truth for the public at all times.
