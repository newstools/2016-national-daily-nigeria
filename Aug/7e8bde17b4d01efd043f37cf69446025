The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Ogun State government have resolved all outstanding issues that have kept 47 base transmission stations (BTS) under lock and had degraded service quality in the state and its environs.
The Executive Vice Chairman, NCC Prof Umar Danbatta who spoke after a visit to Governor Ibikunle Amosun in Abeokuta, yesterday said the development would positively impact on the access to telecoms services in the state.

He said: “We have succeeded in resolving a contentious matter leading to sealing of 47 BTS in the state. The BTS are going to be unsealed immediately. This would enhance the challenge we have of providing telecom access in the state.”
Speaking further, Danbatta expressed satisfaction with the assurances given by the governor in tackling the concerns of multiple taxations and right of way, which are among the non-technical factors conspiring to degrade quality of telecoms services in the country.
