Earlier this year, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested the CEO of the bank, Nnamdi Okonkwo, on the grounds that he allegedly helped a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison Madueke, to launder $153 million during the build up to the presidential election.
Fidelity’s share price dropped -4.88 percent to N1.17 while -11.42 (1 year return to date) percent as investors dump bank stocks on the back of lack of policy direction on the part of the government and bleak economic outlook stoked by falling oil price.
