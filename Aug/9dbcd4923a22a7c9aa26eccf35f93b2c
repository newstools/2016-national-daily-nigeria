Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Nnamdi Okonkwo, who commented on the result, said the lender’s financial performance is reflective of the general slowdown in business activities due to lower government revenues, which is a direct fallout of the free fall in international oil prices.
Okonkwo said rising inflation rate, lower disposable income and tougher operating environment for most sectors of the economy as well as the impact of the devaluation on asset quality has all together impacted financial performance.
“Despite the headwinds above, we continued with the disciplined execution of our medium term strategy and recorded decent growth on key operational metrics; deposits, loans, net interest income, electronic banking income and operating income,” he explained.
The organic loan growth of 7.4 per cent was principally driven by on-lending facilities to the public sector. Cost of risk spiked to 1.4 per cent in first half of this year due to the N4 billion impairment charge taken in the second quarter of this year 2016.
