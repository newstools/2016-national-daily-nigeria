The EFCC has released the Abuja blogger it arrested Monday, and detained for more than one day, over allegations that he was cyber-stalking Ibrahim Magu, the commission’s chairman.
Abubakar Usman is a pro-government blogger who recently wrote and posted a story critical of Magu on his blog.
Michael Bello, counsel to the blogger, said his client was released on administrative bail with conditions that he must make himself available to the EFCC on short notice.

Cyber-stalking is criminalised by the Cyber Crime Act 2015 and it is punishable with a N2 million fine or imprisonment for a year or both.
The act describes cyber-stalking as sending offensive or indecent messages by ICT technolohy to a person in order to annoy or endanger or harass him.
