Based on several complaints,  the AIG mandated operatives attached to the Department of Criminal Investigation and Intellignce of the zone (DCIID) to curb such illegal activities and apprehend anyone or group of persons engaging in such criminal acts on our highways.
To forestall illegal officials from collecting revenue, AIG Ali has challenged government revenue agencies and departments to issue identification marks or personal identity cards to their staff or operatives for easy identification so as to assist the police and other security operatives in law enforcement and order.
The Command Police Public Relations Officer, Superintendent Olumuyiwa Adejobi said in a statement that the zone 2 command was poised to thoroughly cleansed its area of jurisdiction while ensuring of adequate security of lives and property for all and sundry.
