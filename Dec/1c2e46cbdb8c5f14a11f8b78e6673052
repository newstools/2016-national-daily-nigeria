Donald Trump, President-elect, United States of America
Time Magazine on Wednesday  named US President-elect Donald Trump as the 2016 Person of the Year which its editor described as a “straightforward’’ choice.
According to the Magazine, Trump was named due to the way he has shaken up US society before taking office.
The cover of the new edition shows Trump looking over his shoulder from an upholstered armchair with the title “President of the Divided States of America.’’
Time editor Nancy Gibbs told NBC News that Trump’s selection was “one of the more straightforward’’ choices that the magazine has made, after the political novice dominated the 2016 campaign cycle on the way to a surprise victory in the November elections.
“When have we ever seen a single individual who has so defied expectations, broken the rules, violated norms, beaten not one, but two political parties on the way to winning an election that he entered with 100-to-1 odds against him?’’ Gibbs asked.
“I don’t think that we have ever seen one person operating in such an unconventional way and have an impact on the events of the year quite like this, ’’Gibbs said.
The magazine’s declaration was “a very great honour,’’ even though Trump said, he took exception with the cover title and said “I didn’t divide them, they’re divided now.
“There’s a lot of division, and we’re going to put it back together, and we’re going to have a country that’s very well healed and we’re going to be a great economic force.
“We’re going to build up our military and safety, and we’re going to do a lot of great things it’s going to be something very special,’’ Trump said.
