The decision of the state government is part of the white paper released on the clash between the group led by Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and the military over time.
National Daily quotes the white paper as saying: “For all intent and purpose, the IMN is an insurgent group and ought to be treated as such.”
The state government, under Nasir el-Rufai, had set up a panel to investigate the clash that occurred between soldiers and the Islamic group.
The report also quoted the government as saying it would hold El-Zakzaky responsible for all acts carried out by the group’s members.
It said: “Members of the IMN owe absolute loyalty to Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky.
“He therefore bears responsibility for all the acts of lawlessness committed by the organisation and should therefore be held responsible, fully investigated and prosecuted.”
The report also said the soldiers who were alleged to have taken part in the killing of some Shiite faithful will not be punished.
El-Zakzaky has been in detention after being accused of creating a government in Nigeria and acting with impunity.
