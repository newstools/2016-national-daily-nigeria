Players and officials of Rivers United knuckled down to work on Monday following their resumption from the Christmas break.
The team had a three-hour training session which kicked off at 8am at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Port Harcourt.
Physical drills, ball work and basic tactical programmes dominated the session which was overseen by technical manager, Stanley Eguma.
It was the first time the team trained in Port Harcourt in over a month following a comprehensive five-phase pre-season programme that integrated training tours to Abuja, Kaduna, Enugu and several cities in Spain.
Speaking after the session, chief coach of United, Willy Udube explained that it was important to get the troops back in early after the Christmas celebrations.
“2017 will be a very big year for the football club and it is only proper that we commence preparations early for the new season.
“It was also important to give the boys a rest during the Christmas period as it also enabled them to be with their family and friends.
“Their batteries have now been recharged for the task ahead.
“Our first match in the new Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season is less than three weeks away while our first game in the Caf Champions League is just weeks after that.
“We had a very good pre-season but we cannot throw away all that good work by failing to maintain our momentum,” he told National Daily.
Rivers United will compete in the NPFL, the Federation Cup and the Caf Champions League in 2017.
