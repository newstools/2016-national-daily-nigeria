Poised with the determination to rout the menace of kidnappers, the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) has crushed a kidnapper syndicate  in Rivers and Bayelsa states.
National Daily gathered that acting on credible intelligence and public support, on the 29th of November, 2016, they intercepted a four-man gang of heavily armed kidnappers, who are notorious for terrorizing the waterways and kidnapping in Rivers and Bayelsa states.
They were said to have been apprehended along Azikiwe Road, Port Harcourt, Rivers State on their way for an operation.
It was further learnt that in the process, a gun battle ensued, and three of the kidnappers were fatally wounded while one James Peter, 30, from Southern Ijaw LGA of Bayelsa State was arrested.
Confessing to the crime, James was said to have given valuable information about the members of the gang and their modus of operation.
Weapons recovered from the kidnappers include one General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG), one AK47 rifle, chains of GPMG ammunition and two fully loaded AK47 magazines.
Police authorities hinted that efforts are in top gear to arrest fleeing members of the gang and recover their cache of arms.
Meanwhile, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Ibrahim Idris, has called on Nigerians to provide the police with valuable information and assuring them of renewed commitment on the part of the force in the fight against crime and antisocial behaviour.
