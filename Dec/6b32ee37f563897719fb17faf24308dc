The GOC who was addressing officers and soldiers at the 9Brigade Headquarters in Ikeja Lagos admonished the soldiers to conduct themselves professionally.
“Soldiers are to sustain the cordial and harmonious relationship with civilians in Lagos. Remain disciplined in your dealings with civilians and conduct yourselves professionally,’’ Oyefolu reiterated.
Since assuming office as the new GOC a couple of weeks ago, this ia the first familiarisation visit to the army formation within his area of responsibility.
Gen Oyefolu, therefore, urged soldiers to exploit appropriate channels of communication to report any wrong by the civilians to the authority rather going into confrontation with them that would bring about bad image.
On the internal security arrangement, the GOC reminded the troops serving at OP MESA and OP AWATSE, to always adhere strictly to the Rules of Engagement.
“I assure you that the Army authority will continue to attend to your welfare, while congratulating officers and men that benefited from the recent promotion exercise, noting that it was a reward for hard work.
