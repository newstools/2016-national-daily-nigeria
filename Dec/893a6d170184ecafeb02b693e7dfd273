The Senate ad hoc Committee on Mounting Humanitarian Crisis in the North East, headed by Senator Shehu Sani, has uncovered a N2.5 billion fraud allegedly perpetrated by some operators of the Presidential Initiative on the North-East (PINE).
National Daily gathered that the Secretary of PINE claim they spent a sum of N203 million to clear taipa grass in Yobe State.
He also claimed they spent another sum of N253 million to tackle species of the plant in river banks across the states, as well as a sum of N422.5 million to provide temporary shelter to small families in the state.
But the Commissioner for Information in Yobe State, Alhaji Mohammed Lamin, while making his submission before the Senate committee, denied any knowledge of the expenses, adding that there was no evidence of the said projects in the state.
The commissioner also disputed the claims that PINE spent millions to renovate schools destroyed by Boko Haram insurgents in Yobe.
“No Taipa grass was cleared in the state by any Federal Government’s agency,” he insisted
The commissioner also countered the information by the PINE secretary that species around river banks were cleared with a sum of N253 million, adding also that the state did not have evidence of the claim that PINE spent a sum of N422.5 million to provide temporary shelter for families in the state.
