There was heavy presence of security presence at the premises of the Edo State High Court where the State Election Petition tribunal is sitting along Sapele Road in Benin City.
To avert a clash of political parties supporters, roads leading to the court were cordoned off.
The tribunal was scheduled to hear applications filed Governor Godwin Obaseki and the All Progressive Congress against the petition filed by Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party.
Vehicles were allowed to ply one way along the dualised Sapele Road.
At the last tribunal sitting, thugs loyal to both the PDP and the APC stormed the tribunal premises and it resulted in a clash which left about three persons injured.
The heavy security presence prevented suspected thugs from gaining access to the tribunal premises.
