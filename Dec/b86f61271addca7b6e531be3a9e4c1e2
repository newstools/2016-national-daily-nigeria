Sterling Bank of Nigeria and South Africa’s FNB, have emerged winners of “The Excellence in Mobile Banking” award at the 2016 Lafferty Global Awards, according to a statement issued by the Lafferty Group.
Other winners include Diamond Bank of Nigeria which won the Excellence in Financial Inclusion award and Voyager Innovations of the Philippines, winner of the Excellence in Fintech Lending category.
The awards showcase innovative services and products in retail banking, cards and payments and merchant services, with a diverse range of winners from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
“One thing that struck the judges is that almost no area of banking is untouched by mobile technology,” said Lafferty COO Rónán Lynch. “It’s clear to us that banks and payments businesses are spending a lot of their innovation budgets on mobile – and there’s probably a lot more innovation to come in the area of mobile banking, mobile payments and mobile technology. That applies whether we’re talking about wealthy parts of the world or poor parts of the world.”
