Lagos State Governor Mr Akinwunmi Ambode has unveiled plans by his administration to build five new arts theatres across the State as part of efforts to engage the youths and promote tourism through arts and entertainment.
The Governor, who spoke at a stage play titled ‘Heartbeat The Musical…A New Beginning’ held at the Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos and directed by Olu Jacobs and Joke Silver, said the theatres would be up and running before the end of 2017.
Speaking shortly after the stage play, Governor Ambode said he was thoroughly impressed by the production of the play, saying it was a confirmation that Lagos is not only the destination for arts, culture and entertainment, but has a bulging youths ready to showcase their talents.
He said, “I never believed I could sit down for two hours, I thought I would just pop in briefly and then leave, but this is awesome and fantastic, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The mere fact that I believe strongly in arts, entertainment and sports, everything that is arts, like I said, before the end of next year, we are going to have five new theatres in Lagos.
