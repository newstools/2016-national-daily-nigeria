It was a gathering of millions of worshippers from all over the world.
In his sermon on Friday night, The General Overseer of RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, spoke on the topic, ‘Complete restoration’.
The Cleric explained that complete restoration is a process.  He said every Christian is entitled to miracles,  noting that those who are not born again cannot get miracle, because miracles comes from God and God is holy.
Reading from Ezekiel chapter 3, verse 7 to 10, Adeboye said; “Whenever God wants to begin the process of restoration, He remembers the forgotten and miracles are bound to follow. God also he visits the person and something miraculous happens
“Anytime God want to do something there must be a noise; When God arrives, there must be a shaking; nakedness is covered; shame is ended; the  wind blows, and whenever the wind blows there will be miracles,” he said.
The Cleric assured that the blessings of God makes rich and adds no sorrow. “When a miracle comes from God it is clean, with no string are attached and there will be divine protection. “When you are child of God your future is secured. Whatever is available to Jesus is available to you,” he said.
