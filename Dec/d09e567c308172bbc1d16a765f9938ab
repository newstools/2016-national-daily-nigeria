The Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Alhaji Umaru Ibrahim has been re-elected into the Executive Committee of the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) for another term of three years.
Alhaji Umaru was re-elected during the 2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the association which held recently in Soul, Korea and hosted by the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC).
The re-election of the NDIC Managing Director/Chief Executive, according to IADI, was in recognition of the Corporation’s outstanding contributions to the development of deposit insurance practice in Africa and the association as a whole.
The 15th AGM of the association in Seoul, Korea was attended by 180 participants, representing 70 jurisdictions worldwide.
The theme of this year’s conference was: Gearing Up for the Next Crisis, and featured presentations and panel discussion by top policy makers, deposit insurers and prominent academics.
Recall that Ibrahim was first elected unopposed to take the reserved seat of the Africa Regional Committee on the Executive Council of the Association at its 12th AGM and 2013 Annual Conference held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) was formed in May 2002 as a forum for knowledge and experience sharing through international conferences, workshops, attachments and other capacity building programs as well as research and guidance on matters related to deposit insurance for its members.
