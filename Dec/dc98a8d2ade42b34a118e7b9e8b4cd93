A former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has again canvassed the restructuring of the country, asserting that “no section of this country can claim correctly that its people are better served by the current structure of our federation.”
He stated this on Monday in a series of tweets posted on his Twitter handle @atiku, where he pointed out that the country already has too many weak and unviable states and that what is needed are stronger federating units.
While disclosing that the country can be properly restructured with Nigerians first making their grievances and fears clear.
He tweeted that, “What I find odd is the argument that we cannot renegotiate our union and every demand for restructuring is an attempt to break up Nigeria”.
Some of the tweets read, “We must acknowledge that what got us to our centre-dominated federal system is political expediency and fear.
“Each nation has to work out the best system suited for it. In Nigeria’s case, it’s dishonest to say that the system is not the problem.
“We already have too many weak/unviable states. What we need are stronger federating units (be they existing sates or zones)
“No section of this country can claim correctly that its people are better served by the current structure of our federation.
“In federal systems that work, federating units cede certain powers to the centre.
“National unity does not mean the absence of disagreement. In fact disagreements & peaceful agitations indicate vibrant union.
The former vice president had in July made a case for the restructuring of the country, stating that most of the country’s problems would be resolved when that is done.
