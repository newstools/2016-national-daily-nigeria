The Court of Arbitration for Sport said Monday that Sepp Blatter breached FIFA’s ethics codes as it firmly rejected his appeal against a six year ban for making a $2m payment to ousted UEFA chief Michel Platini.
“Mr. Blatter breached the FIFA Code of Ethics since the payment amounted to an undue gift as it had no contractual basis,” said the CAS in a statement which said Blatter’s appeal had been “dismissed.”
