The Nigerian Navy said on Thursday that an attempt to vandalize and siphon oil product from one of the arrested vessels has been foiled by its personnel attached to FOB FORMOSO.
The oil thieves fled and abandoned the three Cotonou boats they brought for their criminal act. The boats are currently in the custody of FOB FORMOSO, while adequate security measure has been provided to prevent any unforeseen situation.
The Director of Information, Commodore Chris Ezekobe explained that its landmark success in the fight against oil bunkering in the Niger Delta area was in consonance with the Federal Government stance on zero tolerance for corruption and oil bunkering.
National Daily gathered that the Nigerian Navy personnel on patrol in NNS PATHFINDER had accosted two Cotonou boats loaded with suspected illegally refined AGO at Onne anchorage.
However, no arrest was made as the occupants of the boats fled on sighting the personnel but the boatsÂ  were said to be destroyed.
In another development, a patrol team of NNS DELTA destroyed four illegal refinery sites with about 30 metric tones of illegally refined AGO and three Cotonou boats carrying about 40 metric tones of suspected stolen crude oil arresting five suspects and recovered 40HP outboard engine and two pumping machines.
