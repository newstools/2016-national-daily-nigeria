The determination of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) to extricate criminal gangs and fraudsters from the society yielded another success as it arraigned one Dr. Vincent Anyigor and his company, Vanyigor Concepts Limited for allegedly defrauding an American of $629,287.
Anyigor was charged before Justice M. A. Liman of the Federal High Court, sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on a 25-count charge bordering on conspiracy, uttering, forgery and obtaining by false pretence to the tune of USD 629,287.00.
The complainant alleged that sometime in October, 2010, he paid the sum of $629,287.00 to Dr. Vincent Anyigor for the supply of Six million barrels of Bonny Light crude oil but neither got the supplies nor a refund of his money.
National Daily gathered that Anyigor was alleged to be the leader of a syndicate and parades himself as an international operator in the oil and gas sector.
The defendant pleaded not guilty when the charge was read to him.
In view of his plea, counsel to EFCC, U. R. Ewoh, asked the court for a date for trial.
However, counsel to the defendant Chief Chuks Muom (SAN) urged the court to grant his client bail as the alleged offence is bailable.
Justice Liman granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100, 000,000 with two sureties in like sum. Each of the sureties must own a landed property worth N50, 000,000.00 within the jurisdiction of the court.
The court bailiff is to verify the property. The defendant is also to deposit his international passport with the court registrar.
The defendant was subsequently remanded in prison custody pending the perfection of his bail while the case was adjourned to 18 and 19 January, 2017 for trial.
