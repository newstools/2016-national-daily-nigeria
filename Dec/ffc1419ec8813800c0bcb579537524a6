The Defence Headquarters has alerted members of the public to be mindful and vigilante of another antic being employed by the escaping Boko Haram terrorists that were smoked out of Sambisa forest as they disguise as menial workers.
The Director, Defence Information (DDI) disclosed in Abuja on Tuesday that information gathered indicated that “some fleeing Boko Haram terrorists are now disguising as menial workers to melt into communities and towns with a view to organising terrorists attack against our innocent citizens.”
Brig Gen Rabe Abubukar explained that the unfortunate bomb blast incidents in Madagali and Maiduguri recently were made possible through such clandestine act.
The Defence Headquarters, therefore, advises citizens to be on the alert and be wary of these tricks employed by the defeated terrorists who are hellbent on remaining relevant despite their lost battle.
National Daily gathered that the  sensitisation becomes necessary to create security awareness and be conscious of some strange faces that could take menial jobs in their communities or towns, especially now that festivities are around the corner.
