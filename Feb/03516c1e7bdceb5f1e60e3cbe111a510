The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has said that it admitted a total of 5,909,497,252 ordinary shares of 50 kobo to the outstanding shares of Cornerstone Insurance Plc to serve as Purchase Consideration for Acquiring 96.68 per cent Stake in FIN Insurance Plc Company Ltd, which translates in to a total outstanding shares of 14,729,507,615 for the company.
This development is coming despite the depressed appetite and negative sentiments by investors on the Exchange, which has dragged the major measurement indicators of the Nigerian Bourse – the NSE All-Share Index and the Market Capitalisation downward.
This waning sentiments is, however, not unconnected with current macro-economic challenges facing the country, which has actually spilled over to other sectors of the country apart from the capital market.
Recall that Nigeria has been battling with forex scarcity brought about by declining external reserves as a result of a sharp drop in the price of oil in the international market and has forced regulators and the government to ration the flow of forex, leading to untold hardship in the country.
