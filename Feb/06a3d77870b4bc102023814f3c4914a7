The Inspector General of Police has warned members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on the directives to its members ‘to carry guns in self defence’, to stop it or face the consequences of their action.






As a result, all Zonal Assistant Inspector General of police and State Commissioners of Police have been directed to strictly enforce the laws against the use of illegal firearms across the length and breadth of the country.
He enjoined IPOB them to reconsider their stand or face the wrath of the extant laws on bearing of firearms.
The IGP who gave the warning in Abuja on Thursday through an electronic statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, (FPPRO), ACP Olabisi Kolawole reiterated that “anybody who dares security agencies in the discharge of their constitutional responsibilities, and make life difficult for law abiding citizens, will face the consequences of their actions.”

He cautioned IPOB members to follow appropriate avenues in ventilating their grievances as anybody who steps out of bounds will be decisively dealt with.
He said, “Members of the group should note that it is an offence punishable under the criminal Law of the Federation of Nigeria for a person to have in his possession or under his control any prohibited firearms without licence or permit.
“The IPOB are advised to be guided in respect of the above as the Police Force is poised to uphold the existing restriction over the use of firearms.
The Inspector-General of Police assured that the Nigeria Police Force, complemented by other security agencies would work “tirelessly and assiduously” towards eliminating any threat to internal security and social disorder.
