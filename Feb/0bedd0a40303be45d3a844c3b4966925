It is when we establish infringement by the operators or actions that are incompatible with the Act that we invoke appropriate provisions of the law pertaining to those infringements and their appropriate sanctions.
He further stated that as a responsible regulator they can just watch as various infringements are being committed with impunity.
“No responsible regulator will stand by and watch this being done by the operators”, he said.
He however stated that their main responsibility is to the Nigeria consumers were there should be fairness when and if infringement are committed then we look at the laws and apply appropriate sanctions on the operator involved.
Danbatta said as a regulator they usually warn the operators and give them the opportunity to explain before disciplinary measures are being taken.
He also made known that the regulatory body is encouraging competition in the telecoms sector in the country and they cannot be applying big sticks on the time on the operators.
