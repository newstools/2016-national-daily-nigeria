…one killed
By OKOSUN DENNIS
Police officers and hoodlums are in serious battle in Oworonshoki area of Lagos state following the death of a 25-year-old man.
The man identified as Monsuru, was killed on Sunday evening at a Valentine’s birthday party held by a cult member in the neighbourhood.
It was learnt that a clash of two cult rivals led to the death of Monsuru’s death.
As a result, some of his friends who were said to be cult members too went gaga and attacked anybody insight.
When men of the police force intervened to stop the conflagration, they withstood the police in a duel leading to unconfirmed number of causalities.
Speaking anonymously, a witness said “Oworonshoki is on fire”, advising commuters to avoid the area.

A source, however, disclosed that some of the hoodlums have been arrested by the police at Oworonshoki
