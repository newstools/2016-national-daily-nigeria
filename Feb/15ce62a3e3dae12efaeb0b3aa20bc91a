The Senate has described the disagreement between the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and MTN Nigeria over the N780 billion fine imposed on the telecoms firm last year as an embarrassment.
Chairman Senate Committee on Communication, Gilbert Nnaji who disclosed this in an interview with journalists in Abuja, also assured that the committee would resolve the matter in a way that all the parties would be happy.

NCC had in October, 2015 imposed N1.04 trillion fine on MTN for failing to fully deactivate subscribers with unregistered and incomplete Subscriber Identification Modules (SIM) cards details on its networks within the stipulated time.
The fine was later reduced to N780 billion but MTN dragged government to court over the fine, arguing that it was outrageous.

Nnaji, said: “We have waded into the impasse between NCC and MTN Nigeria, we have started dialogue but it is still an in-house discussion, it will not be made known to the media until we reach a concrete agreement between NCC, MTN and the Senate Committee on Communication. The matter has become very embarrassing, but with dialogue, the matter will be resolved. We don’t want to hear that we are looking for foreign investors in the country and in the other way round, we are chasing them away, we can’t allow that to happen”.
