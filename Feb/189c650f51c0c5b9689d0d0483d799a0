THE Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has called on local and foreign investors to stake more claims and investments in the telecoms, stressing that the sector has recorded an 11 per cent growth in the number of active internet subscriptions on the mobile communications network.
However, the declining growth rate of the CDMA companies over the GSM operators that exhibit higher growth rate has been attributed to the flourishing investments in technology carried out by major telecoms operators leading to the increase in market share.
The EVC of NCC, Prof.Garba Umar Danbatta disclosed at a recent symposium. The EVC who is also the chairman of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation said that Nigeria is the best place for ICT companies to come and invest.
