Governor Ajimobi had met with some Chinese auto makers sometimes ago, inviting them to set up assembly plants in the State. He said the move was aimed at making the state an industrial hub and the investors’ destination of choice in the country, pointing out those discussions with the manufacturers had reached an advanced stage on the development of a blueprint on the projects.
The Governor added that the projects would be complemented with an industrial park that would serve as feeder companies to the manufacturing companies, with the multiplier effects of creating employment opportunities for the citizenry.
Geely cars which came into the country in 2007 used to be handled by Hyra Motors, but the company fizzled out around 2012 thereby leaving the brand out in the cold until CFAO took charge of the brand again.
