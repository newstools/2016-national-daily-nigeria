AN official of the Federal Fire Service (FFS) Abuja, Mr. Collins Elechi, has blamed delay in sending message to the Fire Service for the damage of the Millennium Plaza.
Elechi, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) made this known to the reporters in Abuja on Saturday during an interview.
Elechi therefore appealed to members of the public not hesitate to call fire fighters once they notice fire outbreak, saying that delay in calling fire fighters increased the level of devastation at the plaza.

“Members of the public should note that every fire outbreak has the potential to consume everything if not quickly nipped in the bud, as late call on fire fighters made the plaza razed down.
“Put distress call across to appropriate authorities when there is fire outbreak and tell them the kind of materials under threat, as well as the cause of the outbreak.
“This will help them to know the kind of chemical to use for effective impact on the fire,” he said.
The PRO said that the fire outbreak did not extend to other buildings around the plaza due to frantic efforts of the fire fighters from federal and state fire service as well as organisations around the area.
