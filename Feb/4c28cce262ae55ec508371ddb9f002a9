Raids Abuja office, seizes $50,000

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has extended its searchlight on former public office holders to former Vice President Namadi Sambo in the ongoing anti-corruption war in the country. The Commission on Monday raided the office of the former Vice President in Abuja in search of vital documents relating to the $2.1 billion arms fund allegedly misappropriated by the National Security Adviser (NSA) to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Colonel Sambo Dasuki.

It was gathered that the raid was aimed at findings that Mallam Daboh, an aide to former Vice President Sambo,  received N25 million from the National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olisah Metuh. It is being suspected that the money paid to Daboh is part of the largess from Dasuki who is still undergoing prosecution on the $2.1 billion arms deal scandal.
Daboh was arrested by the EFCC and  released on January 11 after making a statement.

EFCC’s swoop on Sambo’s Abuja office was gathered to have taken place days after Sambo is believed to have transferred some vital documents to his office in Ghana-must-go bags. The EFCC had expected to find incriminating documents in the raid.
The EFCC was said to have purportedly confiscated $50,000 from the office of the former Vice President as well as taking away branded watches, asset declaration forms, list of landed properties, among other things in a safe deposit box.
