From PRINCE MONDAY WHISKEY, Regional Editor, South South
Commander of the dreaded Iduwini Volunteer Force (IVF) Commander Johnson Biboye has raised alarm over what he called indiscriminate arrest of innocent ijaw youths especially around the Gbaramatu axis and other ijaw communities of Delta and Ondo State by security personnel over allegations of attacks on pipelines without justifiable evidence.
The IVF Commander said, already, over fifteen (15) innocent youths, ten of them being beneficiaries of the Federal Government’s Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), adding that his group has it on good authority that those arrested are been tortured daily to implicate others, while arguing that subjecting such repented freedom fighters to the dehumanizing treatment is capable of creating new crisis in the Niger Delta.
He queried why those who have accepted the Presidential Amnesty Programme through High Chief Government Ekpemupolo a.k.a Tompolo are being targeted for arrest and humiliation, pointing out that the conclusion will be that it is either government has jettisoned the programme and the law guiding it which says once a militant has demobilized and accepted the amnesty programme such persons cannot be arrested without justification or that the Federal Government has decided to declare war against the defenseless ijaw race.

Biboye recalled that there was relative peace in the Niger Delta before the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari took over power, but that today the decision of the government to want to force everybody into APC through cohesion and intimidation has raised tension to a feverish level that can degenerate into a full blown war if care is not taken.
According to Commander Biboye, the Federal Government should hold security agencies saddled with the responsibilities of policing pipelines installation squarely responsible for colluding with notorious gang star leaders for selfish political reasons to blow up pipelines so that there security vote will keep coming.

“The government should know that at a time like this, only a thorough probe of those with the responsibilities of policing such facilities will make government to know the monsters behind this deadly economic sabotage that is being coordinated by people with evil intention”, he counselled.
Concluding, Commander Biboye said, “President Mohammadu Buhari as the father of the Nigerian nation should urgently call the military high command to order and stop forthwith this heavy military siege that has been put in place in various innocent Ijaw Communities that is making inhabitants to move in droves out of such areas for fear of the unknown. Innocent persons and workers are no longer comfortable living side by side with heavily armed military personnel as if we are in war.”
