Nigeria anti graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday arrested former Minister of Interior, Abba Moro, over the 2014 fatal recruitment
exercise into the Nigerian Immigration Service.
Over 20 persons died in stampedes as thousands of applicants who had gathered in
stadia across the country for the exercise struggled to take part in the recruitment.
Former President Goodluck Jonathan had set up a probe into the recruitment fiasco, but the report of the panel was not released until he left office.
There was impunity by the PDP leadership to call Moro to face the law despite calls that the Minister who took over the recruitment from the NIS should be disciplined was not heeded by the former President.

It was believed that President Jonathan spared Moro because he was a protege of David Mark, the President of the Nigeria Senate at the time.
It was learnt that Moro was arrested alongside then Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Interior, Fatima Bamidele on Monday.
Also arrested, according to sources was a director in the Immigrations, Fire Service,
Prisons and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, simply identified as Ibrahim.
It was not clear if Moro and the two persons arrested with him will be allowed to go home but as at 10om Monday night, Moro was still held at the EFCC office.
It was however learnt that Moro will be charged to court after the investigations.
