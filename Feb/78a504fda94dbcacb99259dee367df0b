The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has warned a group of persons who have threatened to embark on acts of sabotage against the Nigerian state to desist from it or be ready to face the wrath of the law.
In a statement by the Director, Defence Information, Brig Gen Rabe Abubakar said in Abuja on Thursday that the DHQ will not condone any acts by individuals or group that is capable of breach to security and economic sabotage in the Niger Delta or in any part of the country.
He explained that the nation’s interest is above that of individual or group’s interest and would not accept acts of sabotage.
Abubakar added: “In as much as the military recognizes the supremacy of the Constitution which guarantees freedom of expression and association, the constitution also frowns against individuals or groups hiding under it to stir up trouble and insecurity in the land.
“Any individual or groups who have genuine complain or grievances should use the available means of dialogue for amicable resolution but certainly not violence, as it will not be tolerated.
“The DHQ will continue to partner with other security agencies to protect and provide enabling environment to all citizens to engage in their respective and legitimate businesses without fear of molestation,” he added.
