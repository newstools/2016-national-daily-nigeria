The recall documents specify that the vehicles contain airbags manufactured by Takata, which was fined a record $200 million last year by the NHTSA for hiding safety concerns over the exploding airbags linked to at least 10 deaths and scores of injuries.
Some 50 million vehicles worldwide were recalled last year over the problem, and major car manufacturers like Honda and Nissan have dumped the Japanese parts supplier.
It added that Honda would notify owners and that dealers would replace the inflator at no cost.
