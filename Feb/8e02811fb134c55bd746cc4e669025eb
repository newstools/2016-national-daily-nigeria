THE National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has warned Batch A prospective corps members against accepting online requests to make payments for posting.
This is contained in a statement signed on Friday by Mrs. Bose Aderibigbe, the NYSC Director of Press, in Abuja.
The statement said such requests were from cyber criminals as the scheme was yet to commence posting, change or posting of prospective corps members.
It said that the deployment of prospective corps members would commence at the appropriate time in line with the laid down processes of the scheme.

The statement said the warning came after the attention of the NYSC management was drawn to the activities of hackers sending messages requesting prospective corps members to go and check their states of deployment online.
It said the hackers often referred their victims to a link asking them to enter their login details as well as choices made during their online registration.
The statement urged prospective corps members to disregard the messages.
It said that the NYSC management would inform prospective corps members as soon as posting letters were ready for printing online or delivery to their various institutions of graduation.
