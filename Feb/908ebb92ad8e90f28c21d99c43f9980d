Police detectives attached to ‘A’ Division Police Station Warri, Delta State, have arrested six female teenagers for alleged sex trade with a man identified as Alhaji Burkar Hassan.
Reports said the incident of their arrest took place last Tuesday following a tip-off around Warri motor park garage during nightfall.
The mother of one of the little girls, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent that she initiated the arrest when she saw the teenagers who resided in the nearby old Welfare street, Warri with her in the Warri Garage area, saying: “When I saw them, I knew that they must know about the whereabouts of my daughter who did not pass the night in my house. It was the first time my daughter, a primary 3 pupil did not sleep in my house. I decided to lodge a complaint to the police at the ‘A’ Division Police, because we have been hearing stories about these girls sleeping with an Alhaji in Otoukutu for money”
