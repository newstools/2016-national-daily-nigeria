Commander Oduku explained that the security outfit had earlier commenced the recruitment of ex-militant leaders and agitators from the Niger Delta, noting that the  recruitment of OPC members will aid the fight against criminalities as they would work in collaboration with Joint Task Force, (JTF) personnel and other security agents.
According to him, “we are currently working on getting maps of oil pipelines from different communities in the coastal region. Our men will be stationed in different communities where oil and gas installations are located for prompt response and intervention should there be any security breach.
“We are ready to confront vandals headlong, because we will not allow a small number of criminals hijack our collective wealth. We have also been brainstorming with some leaders in South-East and North-Central on how best to maintain peace in this region and ensure that the fragile security situation does not get worse.”
