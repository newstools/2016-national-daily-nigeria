THE National Coordinator of Oodua Peoples ‘Congress (OPC), Otunba Gani Adams has called on the Chiefs of Benin Kingdom to steer clear of making historically unbalanced statement capable of upsetting the socio- cultural chord of brotherhood between the children of Oduduwa.
Adams who made the call in response to the lingering controversy stoked by a purported claim of the origin of Yoruba churned out by a chief from the palace of Oba of Benin, said “such poor research, lacking in historical credibility could be inflammatory and set the two nobles race against each other
He pointed out that the relationship between the Yoruba Omo Oduduwa and the Edo is rooted in history shrouded in mystery that served to keep the two vibrant nations together and oil the chord of communal relationship forever.
Otunba Adams said: “Even, though some writers of historical documents about the relationship and chord of brotherhood between the two have allowed personal sentiments and pecuniary consideration to overrule their sense of judgement, clarity, fairness, objectivity and harmonious cohabitation. And the purported statement from a high chief of Benin belong to this trend “

He urged both sides not indulge in diluted information coined by agents of destabilization which emphasized those things that divide them than unite them.
Adams said whatever angle or point of view any writer came out of the discourse, the fact remain constant that there is a bond of relationship which is not fleeting but fundamentally essential between the Yoruba Omo Oodua and the Edo Omo Eweka the Great.
He appealed to the traditional institution s in Benin and Ile Ife to be wary of palace chief who are only out to pitch the two noble royal houses against each other by their sheer impetuosity and face service”
Otunba Adams commended the royal sagacity and visionary posture of the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, and Oba Enitan Adeyeye Babatunde Ogunwusi not only at remaining calm, but at having refused to dignify the sender of those ill research statements with any response
“I must also commend the political maturity and sagacity being displayed by the Imperial Majesty , Oba Enitan Adeyeye Babatunde Ogunwusi , Ojaja 11 who has been consistent in his PEACE DIPLOMACY SHUTTLE among the traditional Obas in Yoruba land which has kicked off a brand new era of harmonious relationship among the Obas in the south west “
