Deputy Governor of Delta State, Barrister Kingsley Burutu Otuaro, on Thursday, described as false reports that he was providing cover for ex-militant leader and founder of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND), Chief Government Ekpemupolo, alias Tompolo.
His Senior Special Assistant, Communication and Press, Mr Bulou Kosin, in a statement in Asaba on Friday said, “The attention of the Deputy Governor, Barr. Kingsley Burutu Otuaro, has been drawn to allegation that he is harbouring High Chief Government Ekpemupolo, aka Tompolo, for who a bench warrant has been issued by a Federal High Court in Lagos for his arrest.”

“The Deputy Governor denies harbouring Tompolo. The allegation is figment of the imagination of detractors. “On the allegation that he is complicit on the alleged N13billion fraud, the Deputy Governor, Barr. Otuaro, wishes to state that the matter is subjudice as same is before a court of law. The media is therefore advised to await the outcome of the case rather than preempt the case,” he said
