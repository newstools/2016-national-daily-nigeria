THE leading contender for the gubernatorial ticket on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Edo state , Maj-Gen. Charles Airhiavbere has debunked the notion that the state leadership of the party has anointed a particular aspirant ahead of the APC primaries.
Airhiavbere who formally inundated his kinsmen of his guber ambition weekend at Agbodo community in Oredo local government area of Edo south, said that only the best candidate will emerge in the primaries,
added, ” Nobody will impose candidate on Edo APC and only the Best Candidate will be accepted”.

The former chief accountant of the Nigerian Army debunked rumours making the round that a close functionary of the Edo state Government has been penciled down for the APC Governorship ticket.
He said that, it is laughable to think that Edo APC is capable of skewing the guber primaries in favour of a preferred aspirant, adding that, “Edo State cannot afford to be different in the political scheme of things with the APC led federal government in the country.
The APC Primaries in Lagos, Kogi and Bayelsa state, were all transparent and Edo State cannot be different, coupled with the fact that Edo state is the only APC state in the South-South.”
Airhivabere, who called on contestants on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC), to see the primaries as a exercise to test their popularity amongst the party delegates noted that the President Muhammadu Buhari led APC government is known for transparency and frowns at disrespect for the rule of law.
According to him, “the National Leadership of the ruling APC will ensure transparency at the Edo APC primaries to ensure that the electoral process is not skewed in favour of a particular or anointed aspirant.
