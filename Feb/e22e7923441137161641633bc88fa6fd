President Muhammadu Buhari has said the anti-corruption fight with respect to the Nigerian judiciary is giving him a headache now.
He stated this on Sunday in Addis Ababa where he was addressing Nigerians living in Ethiopia.
In a statement made available by his media aide Femi Adesina, Buhari narrated how the judiciary worked against him for 12 years before “God and technology” eventually made him president of Nigeria in 2015.
The president said that far-reaching reforms of the judiciary is a key priority for his administration, adding that with the support of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, he would continue to do his best to improve the nation’s judicial administration system.

He also told his audience the federal government has ordered a review of several railway transport projects signed by the previous administration with the Chinese government.
“The Chinese government was very generous to Nigeria on the projects signed with the previous government because they agreed to pay 85 per cent of the project.
“But, the Nigerian government was unable to meet up with its counterpart funding of 15 per cent, so the Chinese government was unable to make any impact on the project,’’ he said.

He also spoke on his 2016 budget proposal which he claimed will be the first to ever be financed by non-oil revenues.
