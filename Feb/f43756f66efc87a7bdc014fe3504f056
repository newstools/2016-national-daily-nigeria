My administration will partner the 11-member Economic Community of Central Africa States (ECCAS) to rid Nigeria and its neighbours of the menace of Boko Haram, President Muhamadu Buhari said on Friday in Abuja when he received a message from President Obiang Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea.
The president welcomed the effort to organise a joint meeting between ECCAS and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) with a view to coordinating their responses to the threat of terrorism in the Lake Chad Basin area.

He noted the role of Mbasogo in bringing about the proposed summit and described the effort as very commendable.
Buhari said he was deeply touched by the commitment shown in Nigeria’s security by Equatorial Guinea and gave assurances of his commitment to enhancing security and bilateral relations between the two countries.
The Special Envoy of the Equatorial Guinean President, Mr Juan Nchuchuma, who brought the message, said his president was prepared to expand and share security intelligence and information with Nigeria to help in the war against corruption and terrorism.
He also requested for a meeting of the security chiefs from both countries.
