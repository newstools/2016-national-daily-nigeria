Operatives of the Nigeria Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Delta State have arrested six suspected bush burners in Sapele and Oghara communities and six suspected pipeline vandals in Ogwashi-Uku community near Asaba.
The suspects were said to have been arrested in the early hours of on Friday on a tip-off and the help of various vigilante groups in the areas.
The NSCDC Commandant in the state, Mrs. Beatrice Irabor who spoke to journalists in Asaba, said that based on the power granted the corps to prosecute pipeline vandals in accordance to the NSCDC amendment act 2007, the suspects are being prosecuted.

She said that Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps having come a long way in effort in fighting criminality as established by act No. 2 of 2003, has numerous security responsibilities, and appealed to Federal and State Governments to provide it with the equipment to further strengthen and empower the corps for better service delivery.
She said that the suspects upon interrogation confessed to the crime, adding that one of the major impacts of the amended act, is the power of prosecution granted to the NSCDC which operates under the umbrella body of the International Civil Defence Organization as its 66 members, an indication that it has a distinct mandate for other security agencies.
