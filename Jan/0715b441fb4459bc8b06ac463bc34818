The Commissioner for Health in Rivers, Dr Theophilus Odagme, has confirmed that three persons have died, while more than 200 others are currently under observation, following the outbreak of Lassa Fever in the state.
Odagme made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt on Saturday.
He said that up to 50 people who had contacts with the first reported two cases could be out of observation because they had not shown symptoms of the disease.
The commissioner said that the medical doctor, who died after contracting the disease, had been buried after consultations with the family.
He said the doctor died at a hospital outside Port Harcourt and that contacts he had hours before his death were among those under observation.
According to the commissioner, government has set up a special centre to manage new cases of the disease, noting that no new case has been reported.
Odagme also said that the State Government was working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Federal Ministry of Health to tackle the disease.
â€œWe have been working with WHO and the Federal Ministry of Health. They are with us in ensuring that their supports come on board.
They are with us.
He advised people with symptoms of the disease to report to the nearest health centre for test and treatment.
