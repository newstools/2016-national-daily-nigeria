PDP’s National Publicity Secretary Olisa Metuh has been returned to the Kuje Prison after the EFCC slapped him with a fresh two-count charge for attempting to destroy confessional statement when he was under investigation.
Metuh was granted bail Tuesday. It is, however, likely he has yet to meet the bail condition—N400 million, two sureties in like sum, and properties in Abuja—for the first charge of corruption levelled by the EFCC against him for collecting N400 million from the $2.1 billion arms vote.
The opposition spokesman was brought to the FCT High Court Thursday in handcuffs, which were taken off moments to his arraignment before Justice Ishaq Bello.
Count one of the charge contains allegation of destruction of a statement Metuh gave at the commission, to prevent it from being produced. Count two of the charge centres on allegations of mischief, all punishable under section 327 of the Penal Code Act
After Metuh pleaded not guilty to the charges, counsel to the EFCC, Sylvanus Tahir, asked for more time to allow his team present witnesses and evidence in support of the allegations against the accused.
Justice Bello said the EFCC must produce three witnesses during the next sitting, without fail.
He also maintained it was needless to have the case brought before him if it was already ongoing at a Federal High Court.
But Sylvanus explained that the new charges, filed on January 18, were not the same as those currently being heard at the Federal High Court.
The matter was adjourned till January 25, for hearing of bail applications.
