THIS is not the best of time for the immediate past Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) Abdullahi Dikko, as the Federal Government may have placed security agents at the nation’s airports and borders on red alert.
The alert was to place the embattled former CG under arrest as soon as he is sighted.
EFCC operatives in two buses had stormed Dikko’s residence at Jabi in Abuja and conducted a thorough search. Sources within the anti-graft agency said the search took several hours and only ended at about dusk. However, the agents did not meet Dikko at home.
Last week, the EFCC had relaxed the siege on the residence of the former Comptroller General of Customs. But a senior official of the commission said the EFCC had learnt that Dikko had travelled to Dubai. He said that the former CG of customs would be arrested on his arrival back into the country as security agents at airports had been alerted to do so.
The source did not give the reason for Dikko’s trip to Dubai. He also refused to speak on the specifics of the investigation or the reason for the high-profile raid. It was also gathered that a high-powered delegation of top operatives of the commission was billed to travel outside the country for a mission connected with the ongoing investigation.
The source said, “The commission has information that the man is in Dubai. I can’t say precisely why he is in the UAE; you know that most of our leaders have one problem or the other, medically, which makes them travel out. But we have informed airport authorities in Lagos and Abuja to pick him up as soon as he arrives.”
