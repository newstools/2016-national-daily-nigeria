President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Nigeria will fully redeem its pledge of 100 million dollars for the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to enhance the operations of the Task Force against Boko Haram.
This information is contained in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday by Mr Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Buhari
The statement said the president was speaking at a high-level meeting of the African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council.
President Buhari said that having already released 21million dollars to the task force in June 2015, Nigeria would remit the balance of 79million dollars very soon.
He also assured the Council that Boko Haram’s capacity to conduct conventional attacks had been “heavily degraded’’.
“As at now, there is no single Nigerian territory under the control of the insurgents other than their hideouts in Sambisa Forest.
“Internally Displaced persons (IDPs) are now being resettled in their respective homes.
“This feat totally accords with our promise to Nigerians to rid the country of terrorism and extremism within few months of our assumption of office.
“Our efforts are already yielding dividends and we will not relent until the terrorist groups are totally decimated and wiped out of our country and sub-region,’’ he declared.
The President also reaffirmed Nigeria’s readiness to support measures to end the conflicts in Burundi and South Sudan, including the proposed deployment of troops by the AU to Burundi.
He, therefore, reiterated Nigeria’s deep commitment to ensuring durable peace, stability and security across the continent.
According to him, without peace, there will be no development.
“It is, therefore, vital for all of us to join hands in taking appropriate measures to end the conflicts and bring a stop to the incalculable damage being inflicted on innocent citizens in the affected countries,’’ the statement quoted the President as telling the participants at the meeting.
