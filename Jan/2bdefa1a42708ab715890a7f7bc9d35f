Super Eagles’ assistant coach Jean Losciuto on Friday in Abuja assured of the home-based team’s readiness for the 2016 African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Rwanda.
Losciuto, however, told newsmen at the team’s occasional interactive session with the media that the team’s handlers were presently faced with the challenge of players’ selection.
“There are presently 25 players with us in camp, but we need to go with 23 players. So, we are faced with this challenge because all the players are good.
“However, the final 23-man list is not ready yet, and we need to do the selection before our departure to South Africa in preparation for the 2016 CHAN,’’ he said.
The Belgian said the players were in good shape and physically fit for the championship.
He also assured that he was in constant contact with the team’s Head Coach, Sunday Oliseh, on the team’s preparation for the event scheduled for later this month.
National Daily reports that the 2016 CHAN, which is the fourth edition and is for players featuring in the domestic leagues in Africa, holds from Jan. 16 to Feb. 7
