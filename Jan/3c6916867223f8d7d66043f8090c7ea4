The NSE Chief Executive Officer, Mr Oscar Onyema, said that market capitalisation which has lost about N250 billion in five days may continue the trend with dwindling oil price and other challenging economic policies.
Speaking on the back drop of the continued decline in overall market capitalisation, Onyema said the market trend was a reflection of the nation’s economic condition. He said that the NSE would continue to position itself to be a credible platform for financing government’s deficit.
He said foreign buyers, who accounted for 54 per cent of trading volume, were on the sidelines owing to lack of clarity on Nigeria’s FOREX policy
