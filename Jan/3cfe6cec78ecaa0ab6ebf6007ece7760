Nigerian fashion label, T.I Nathan presents the “Soliloquy” collection. Recently showcased at the Heineken Lagos Fashion & Design Week 2015, the collection is a fusion of art and style based on love and heart break. The collection is a personal note from the designer, Temitayo Ilesanmi, and describes his emotional journey throughout the collection
The collection is a beautiful adventure through the maze of heartbreak and love, and all the feelings derived from that experience. It is also a reflection of one’s true self – understanding oneself and emotions.
