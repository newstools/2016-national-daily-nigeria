The Executive Secretary, Nigeria Institution of Surveyors (NIS), Mr. Akomolafe Ademola, Lagos State branch, has called for the review of Lagos State Survey Edict of 1984.
Ademola, in an interview with reporters in Lagos on Thursday, said that the review would liberalise the operations of land surveyors in the state.
He said that the edict restricted the operations of surveyors to certain areas in the state, saying that they were not allowed to operate in “Government Reserved Areas.’’
“If the state government can review the edict and liberalise the operations of surveyors, it will enable them to work in any part of the state.
“It will motivate people to practice the profession within the state and increase their contributions to the nation’s development,” Ademola said.
He also urged the state government to liberalise the process of obtaining the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) to ease the operations and activities of surveyors.
Ademola said that the delays, difficulties, financial requirements and other challenges being encountered in processing the C of O had discouraged many people from getting land titles.
According to him, the inability to get the land title will invariably prevent landowners and developers from engaging the services of surveyors.
“It is only when landowners get the C of O and land title that they can think of engaging the service of surveyors to survey their land,” Ademola said.
