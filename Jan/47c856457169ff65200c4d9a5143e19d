After a moment of uneasy calm, Boko Haram on Friday resonated its season of anomie detonating a suicide vest at a crowded market in Gombi town in Adamawa state.
A security official in Gombi said a teen about 12 years old was suspected of having led the
attack.
A vigilante leader confirmed the incident saying that 20 people including the bomber died in the explosion.
The military authorities at the 23 Armoured Brigade in Yola is said to be making deployment.
The Northeast Information Officer of the National Emergency Management Agency
(NEMA) Abdulkadir Ibrahim, said that eight people died while 27 others sustained different degrees of injuries.
Other residents in the area who spoke with newsmen said they saw mutilated bodies as
they ran in panic, with traders abandoning their stalls.
Gombi was recaptured from Boko Haram in 2014 and since then, the terrorists have made several failed attempts to recapture the town from the Nigerian army.
Just before 2015 was over, President Muhammadu Buhari announced that he had
succeeded in his pledge, claiming that Boko Haram is now “technically defeated”
However, despite successes, the sect is still far from being eliminated.
