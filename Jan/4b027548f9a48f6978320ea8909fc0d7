The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers has said it had nothing to do with recent raids by security operatives in the state.
Security operatives carried out raids in suspected hideouts in two Local Government Areas of the state in search of arms.
Mr. Chris Finebone, the state Publicity Secretary of the party, in a statement he issued to newsmen in Port Harcourt on Monday, said that reports attributing the security raids to the party were dishonest.
“This trend of narrative being dishonestly foisted on the people through the media is most uncharitable, manifestly dishonest and flies in the face of logical reasoning.
“The APC, as a political party, has no mandate to embark on security duties either on its own or in conjunction with security agencies under any circumstances whatsoever,” he said.
Finebone said that the APC had restricted itself to the function of seeking political power through legitimate political process.
He urged the people to resist the lure of being misled by such reports and urged them to cooperate with security agencies to fight crime in the state.
