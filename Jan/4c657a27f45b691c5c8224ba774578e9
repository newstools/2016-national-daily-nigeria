Tony Anenih, PDP BOT ex-chairman, was under the knife for a cardiac procedure in an unnamed UK in December. And the open-heart surgery was successful, according to family members who recently told TheCable.
The 82-year-old was said to have visited the UK, and was about coming back to Nigeria when his heart skipped a beat. An emergency call later saw Mr. Fix It stretchered out into an ambulance.
“It was at the hospital that it was discovered he had some heart issues which he had not experienced before,” a source told the online newspaper.
Anenih returned to Nigeria before Christmas, and the report confirmed he was not entirely in the pnk.
Another family member confirmed the incident, adding it was God who saved the octogenarian.
