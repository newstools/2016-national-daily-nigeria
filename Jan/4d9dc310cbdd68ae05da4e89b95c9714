Gov. Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa has called for a peaceful, violence-free supplementary election scheduled to hold on Jan. 9.
Dickson made the call in Yenagoa on Monday during a news conference.
While commending his supporters for their conduct during the Dec. 5, 2015 election, Dickson said that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state had worked hard during the electioneering campaigns.
He urged the people of the state to be courageous and vote massively for PDP, expressing optimism that the party was the real party for change.
“Our party is not going to support violence during the supplementary election.
“We, therefore, urge our people to support the peace campaign because the election is for Bayelsa people.
“We must know that election in this present time is based on Permanent Voter Card (PVC).
“We must make it possible for the people in Southern-Ijaw to cast their votes in a free and fair poll.
He also expressed delight that the people were getting more and more determined to vote for the candidate of their choice.
While stressing that election must not be a do or die affair, Dickson urged the people not to engage in political violence.
“I urge you my people, because we do not need to kill and maim to succeed for power; let us say no to political violence.
“The law enforcement agencies must double their effort in ensuring that what happened on Dec. 5 does not repeat itself in those areas.”
The governor said the contact telephone numbers dedicated to election violence during the supplementary election were 08144075097 and 0903439575.
“We also have a website — savetheijawnation.com, “ Dickson said.
National Daily recalls that the Bayelsa Dec. 5 gubernatorial poll was declared inconclusive by INEC due to violence that marred the process in the Southern-Ijaw Local Government Area.
INEC cancelled election in the affected areas, wards and units and fixed fresh election for Jan. 9.
