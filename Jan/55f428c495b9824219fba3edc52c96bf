A Federal High Court judge has ordered that the custody of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra and founder of Radio Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, be relinquished by the Department of State Services. Nnamdi Kanu was arraigned before the court on Wednesday, January 20 on trial for charges bordering on treason and his agitations for the Republic of Biafra from Nigeria. Recall that Mr Kanu was supposed to appear before the Federal High Court Abuja, on Monday, but the much awaited case was adjourned due to the absence of the judge.
This is equally following the killing of eight  members of the the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB in Aba by the military during their  peaceful protest over the continued detention of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu on Monday,
The presiding judge, Justice James Tsoho during the hearing ordered that Nnamdi Kanu be taken to prison instead of being kept in custody of the DSS overruling the request by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Mohammed Diri, for the continued incarceration of Kanu by the DSS.
Kanu has been in the custody of the DSS since October 14, 2015 when he was arrested by agents of the Department. Kanu’s defence team led by Chuks Mouoma (SAN)‎, had complained that the DSS denied the accused access to his family members and lawyers. Kanu was arraigned alongside Benjamin Madubugwu and David Nwawuisi.
