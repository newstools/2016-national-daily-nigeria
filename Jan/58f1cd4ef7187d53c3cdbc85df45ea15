The 2015 edition of the Headies Awards ended in pandemonium after Don Jazzy and his Mavin crew stormed out of the event premises. Just a few moments after Olamide and his goons had also dashed out the venue in anger. And so the show ends in a way the organizers didn’t planned. Although the edition was themed ‘Flip The Script’ but the epilogue of the event got over flipped. Ediale Kingsley tweets live from the show venue (read upwards from down).

May be artistes should now submit their works to enter for The Headies Awards. That way we know you were not coerced against your will.  The Headies Awards is seeing a decline in its level of organization and drop of rating as well. This is sad. The flipside edition was truly a flipside…but where it flipped to was not positive.
********
Now let’s examine Don Jazzy’s statement while he came out to collect his special recognition awards. He said he hates awards, that he was here for his children, and that he already told them he would buy them cars. That they should take their eyes off this one. He also hinted us that Reekado Banks was at Alibaba’s show…they had to go and hustle him off the stage while he was performing by the prompting of the Headies Awards organizers. Ok, soothe question is why did himself and Reekado had their hearts in their mouth when Bovi pulled the Steve Harvey stunt on them? They got so relieved after the denouement of the conflict joke that Reekado had to ricochet his Jacket at Bovi and Don Jazzy gave a conspicuous loud breath of relief.  The footage that came on while he stood to receive the award from Tony Okoroji is an interview documentary of him saying he derives joy seeing the kids happy and excited when they pick up these awards. So adding all these up, they don’t add up. If you don’t like awards you won’t be bothered about the Bovi joke. You won’t have to go drag Reeky from his Alibaba stage. If you are happy seeing your kids happy because they pick awards…then I think you do like awards. You may only not like the issues that comes with it…like Olamide’s venom or the worry of it corrupting your ‘kids’. Least they start thinking they are set to be on their own and you end up having another Dbanj or Wande Coal rebellion. But dont say you dont like awards.
Then I should think Olamide has a good reason to lose his cool. Even Ronaldo (sorry Reekado) admits the Messi shivers he gets from Lil Kesh. “Lil Kesh…you dey make me feel like say I no get talent...” he said in his acceptance speech. “Lil Kesh has released back to back smashing hits” Said Olamide while showing his fury in the acceptance speech upon going to receive the Adekunle Gold’s best alternative music award. So I would have thought Don Jazzy was going to talk about his lad like that. I may have issue with the lyrical contents of Lil Kesh but since (as observed) it’s no yardstick or standard check for the Headies organizers then clearly Lil Kesh is the real deal. Aside Kataput I really don’t see any monster hit that came from Reekado. At a point in that footage mentioned earlier, when the interviewer mentioned that Don Jazzy has picked the producer of the year award four times…Don Jazzy giggles for comic relief with ear to ear size smile to boast about the possibility of it being more than the mentioned four. So I won’t take the-I-dont-like-awards- sermon.

Bovi and Kaffy are the collaborating Compere for tonight’s show. And like every true entertainer he had priestly themed his jokes and punch lines on beefs and negative energy between Nigerian Entertainers. He even went as far as comicly chronicling the beefs of 2015.  Alas…The 2015 headies ends in beef. I know it’s a new year but I think it will be wrong to ascribe this beef to 2016…it’s a product of 2015. So we can safely truly see 2015 as the year of beef. ‪#‎TheHeadiesToNights.
