While adjourning the suit which was just coming up for preliminary hearing, Justice Buba said only one of the 17 accused persons was present in Court. He therefore urged the Complainant Counsels to ensure that all accused persons should be properly served the Court summons before the suit comes up for hearing on the 9th of February, 2016.
According to the Petitioner, Chief Michael Emerah, Chairman/Managing Director of Micmerah Int’l Agency ltd, he had earlier petition the Former Attorney General of the Federation, Muhammed Bello Adoke (SAN), whom he said fraudulently withdrawn the criminal charge in suit number FHC/ABJ/CR/122/08 despite all the evidences submitted by the Police.
He said he was denied justice by the past administration, and since President Buhari is seen as an upright leader that abhors corruption, he decided to reopen the petition with all the Police report attached.
One of the Counsels to the Complainant, Gordy Uche (SAN) told journalists at the premises of the Federal High Court, Ikoyi that the accused persons have been avoiding receipt of the court summon. He however said the that they would explore other opportunities, including the Police in ensuring that the accused persons acknowledge receipts of the Court summons for the suit to proceed.
