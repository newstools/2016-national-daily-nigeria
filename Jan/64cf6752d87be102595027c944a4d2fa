A woman in India suffered a shoulder injury when she was struck by a falling ball of frozen matter believed to be human waste from an airplane toilet. Witnesses said Rajrani Gaud, 60, was struck in the shoulder Dec. 17 by a block of ice believed to contain human urine and feces dropped from an airplane flying over Aamkhoh village in Madhya Pradesh.
“I was only 25 feet away from the spot where the monster came crashing down. Children and villagers witnessed the fall and then heard screams. We ran towards Rajrani’s house and referred her to hospital,” Deepak Jain, a government school teacher in Aamkhoh village, told the Times of India. Jain said the woman narrowly avoided incurring more serious injuries.
“The ice ball hit the roof first. Otherwise, it would have smashed her skull,” he said. Aviation experts suggested the falling object may have been “blue ice,” a term referring to waste dropped from an airplane lavatory. They said liquid waste may have leaked from a plane and froze on its way down to earth.
District officials said they did not open an investigation into the incident as it hadn’t been officially reported, but aviation consultant Bimal Kumar Srivastava said he reported the object to the director general of civil aviation and the director general of the India Meteorological Department.
Meanwhile, a similar incident happened in New Zealand and Pennsylvania, according to reports. A woman said her house was covered in “poo” she believed to have fallen from an airplane in September 2014, and a Pennsylvania Sweet 16 party came to an abrupt end in May 2015 when suspected airplane bathroom waste rained down from above.
