Super Eagles head coach, Sunday Oliseh has attributed his teams dismal outing at the ongoing CHAN 2016 in Rwanda to lack of motivation.According to the former Super Eagles captain, his team could be likened to a car without fuel, adding that with such things happening, “”there is no way the players who have family could put in their best. They have a lot of dependents and when there was nothing to ginger them, this is the type of result you get. They are family men who have blood running in their vein”,he said.
The Super Eagles team B failed to advance into the quarterfinal stage of the championship having lost its last group stage match 0-1 to Guinea.
Oliseh, speaking Thursday, maintained his stance that his team was  not well motivated for the championship by the Nigeria Football Federation before and during the championship. He went on to say that the technical crew of the team was the worst equipped crew since his days as  a player till date.
National Daily investigation revealed that the players did not receive any allowance since the team moved to camp for preparation up till their last day on Tuesday when they lost the last group stage match,aside from the $10,000 LMC boss, Shehu Dikko gave the players courtesy of the League Management Company.
The team is expected back in the country today.
