The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, has called for synergy between the Federal Government and religious institutions to curb corruption in the country.
Onaiyekan made the call on Saturday in Abuja while speaking with newsmen at a priestly ordination of nine priests at Our Lady Queen of Nigeria, Pro- Cathedral Catholic Church. He said that the church was ready to cooperate with the government in the fight against corruption. He advised Christians to contribute in their own way to tackle the problem, adding that the Catholic Church had fought and condemned corrupt practices for 20 years. He said:
“there should be a clear synergy between government institutions and religious institutions to come together in the corruption battle. “There should be some arrangements whereby government and religious leaders can sit down and see how they can contribute towards the fight against corruption.
“If the government want people to change, they have to get religious institutions involved.
“They (religious institutions) are experienced in that aspect but if you are not reaching out to them, then people will not listen,’’ he said. Earlier during his homily, Onaiyekan told the newly ordained priests to standout for spiritual realities and honest living so that other people would emulate the virtues from them.
“This is the first mark of a long journey and we expect you to stay focused and resolute.
“We must acknowledge that we are beneficiaries of God’s grace; we must bring the good news to the society.
“You must embrace the priesthood that will come with challenges and desist from material things,’’ he said. In an interview with newsmen, Rev. Fr Cephas Magaji, one of the newly ordained priests, said that priesthood was a precious gift from God and should not be taken for granted. Also speaking, Rev. Fr. Vincent Iletogbe, another ordained priest, said that the watchword of priesthood should be service and obedience to the will of God.
