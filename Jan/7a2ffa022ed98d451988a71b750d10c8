Most petrol stations in Badagry area of Lagos State still sell petrol at either N87 per litre or above as against the newly approved pump of N86.50, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports.
NAN reports that the Federal Government had directed that official pump price from January, 2016 should be N86.50 per litre.
The nozzles of some of the independent oil marketers’ filling stations NAN visited on Monday in Badagry still displayed N87 as their pump price per litre.
However, NAN observed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) retail outlet was selling the product at N 86 per litre.
Some motorists who spoke to NAN urged officials of Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) to check the activities of some of the stations in Badagry.
Mr Jeff Madubike, a businessman, lamented the situation saying it had seriously affected his business.
“Most stations in this area only open at night and they sell for N100 per litre or above and this is not meant to be so.
“They usually lock up their stations in the day time only to sell at night.
“The agency of government authorised to check the excesses of these independent markets need to visit Badagry and sanction them, he said.
Also, Mr Ahmed Musa, a commercial motorcyclist (aka Okada rider), said that most stations had fuel in their dumps but they were hoarding the product.
“The government should come to our help in Badagry,’’ he said.
