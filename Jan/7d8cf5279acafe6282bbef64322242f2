Dr Olusola Obada, Pro-chancellor and chairman, Governing Council, Federal University, Dustin-ma, Katsina State, has urged the Federal Government to approve special grant to enable the institution complete some infrastructural projects.
Obada made the call on Saturday in Dutsin-ma during the maiden convocation of the university. She said that the special grant would be used to provide road networks, connect the institution to the national grid and establish water treatment plant.
“The funds will also be used to fence the university, build staff residential houses, and for the provision of clinic and sports facilities at the permanent site. “The government should also take a close look at the allocation of funds for running the university, often called overhead because it is what drives the system after physical structures. “It is our humble suggestion that the formula for allocation for the running cost should relate to the personnel cost, which should not be less than 20 per cent of personnel cost,’’ she said.
The Pro-chancellor said that since the university would soon relocate to its permanent site, there was need for the government hasten approval of the request to enhance teaching and learning in the institution.
The chancellor of the University, the Jaja of Opobo, King Douglas Jaja, commended the Federal Government for providing funds to develop the university within a short period. “Let me publicly appreciate this effort and further appeal that government should not be tired of additional requests that will be coming from the institution.
“Just as a child requires much milk to grow, the young institution requires all the support it can get to deliver on its mandates,’’ he said.
National Daily reports that the institution, which was established in 2010, graduated 110 students.
