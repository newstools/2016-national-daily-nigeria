In a bid to forestall break down of security and order in the country, President Muhammadu Buhari today charged telecommunication companies operating in Nigeria not to place their desire for huge profits above the security needs of the country.
Speaking at an interactive forum with members of the Nigerian Community in Abu Dhabi, President Buhari said that the war against terrorism can only be won with collective effort and a commitment by all stakeholders to work in unison to halt the scourge.
Remarking that the registration of all mobile phone users without exception will help the security agencies to pre-empt terrorist attacks, the President said that telecommunication companies operating in Nigeria must adhere to the rules and guidelines of the Nigerian Communications Commission in this regard.
Similarly, Buhari told the gathering that his administration is ready to deal with the seeming resurgence of oil theft, vandalisation of pipelines and insecurity in the Niger Delta.
Declaring that the Nigerian Armed Forces had already dealt “deadly blows” on Boko Haram, the President said that the activities of oil thieves and vandals will soon be brought to an end.
“The oil thieves and abductors are a less problematic target. We will re-organise and deal with them.”
