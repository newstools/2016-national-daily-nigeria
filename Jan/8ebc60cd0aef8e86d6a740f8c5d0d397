Management of MTN says it will not pay the N780 billion fine imposed on it by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).
The telecommunications firm made its position known in a statement released yesterday.
The company Public Relations and Protocol manager at MTN Nigeria, Mr. Funsho Aina, said when a case was in court, there was a limit to the comments that could be made on it.
He said, “Suffice it to say that based on the lis pendens rule (pending legal action), all parties are enjoined to restrain from taking further action until the matter is finally determined. This is consistent with previous judicial decisions in Nigeria.”
Aina said that notwithstanding the lawsuit, “we would continue to engage with the Nigerian authorities to try and ensure an amicable resolution in the best interest of the company, its stakeholders and the Nigerian authorities.”
He added, “We urge our customers not to panic as we do not envisage any disruption to our operations.”
Also a source at the Commission told National Daily that “MTN did not pay the fine before close of work yesterday and so the Commission will take a fresh decision on the issue Monday”
Meanwhile, Mr. Victor Oluwadamilare, spokesman for the Minister for Communications, Adebayo Shittu, has insisted that MTN will have to pay the fine.
“MTN has the right to seek the court’s interpretation if it feels unsatisfied with the action of the regulator but nothing would stop the government action on the fine,” Oluwadamilare said.
On the side, MTN Nigeria said it did not expect any service disruption on its network as deadline for payment of   N1.04 trillion fine, later reduced to N780 billion by the NCC.
The fine, which according to NCC, was against the inability of MTN to disconnect about 5.1 million subscribers allegedly not properly registered on its network in August and September 2015, was meant to be paid on or before December 31, 2015.
