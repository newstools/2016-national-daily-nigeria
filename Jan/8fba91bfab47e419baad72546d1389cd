…invites EOI from reputable contractors

In a bid to live up to expectation and regain confidence of its critics against the dereliction of its headquarters, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has initiated steps to construct a befitting corporate headquarters soon.
In a statement, the authority said the process commenced with the invitation of competent and reputable companies to submit their Expression of Interest (EOI) for the design and supervision of the construction of a new corporate headquarters for the organization.
The Corporate Affairs Manager of FAAN, Yakubu Dati, said the project, which was advertised in several national dailies and the Federal Tenders Journal on Monday January 11, 2016, would be funded through the Authority’s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) budget for the year 2016.
Dati said submission of “Expression of Interest” for this project will close at exactly 11:30am on Monday, February 29, 2016.
It could be recalled that the Honourable Minister of Transport, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, on his first visit to the corporate headquarters of FAAN, directed that the Authority commence the procedure for the building of a befitting corporate headquarters.
