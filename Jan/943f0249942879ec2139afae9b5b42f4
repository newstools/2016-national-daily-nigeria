The Lagos State University, Ojo is welcoming its management to the new year with signing of nominal roll before the fifth day of every month or lose salaries.
The directive, which is affecting both the academic and non-academic members of staff is to commence this January 2016. Members of staff must henceforth resume the signing of the nominal roll in their various faculties, colleges, schools, departments, centres and units from January 2016.
According to a bulletin made available to the press, “The university management also reiterates that as it is the practice, failure to submit the nominal roll by the fifth of every month by any faculty, college, school, department, centre or unit will lead to the forfeiture of salary of the concerned member of staff for that month.”
The nominal roll has been the practice in the institution but was terminated because of the brawl which erupted between the former Vice Chancellor, Prof. J. Obafunwa and the workers union.
Following the tenure expiration of the former VC, both the workers and the students are looking forward to the appointment of a new VC for the institution by the state government.
