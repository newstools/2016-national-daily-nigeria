From ODIMMEGWA JOHNPETER, Abuja

AREWA Patriotic People’s Assembly has condemned what it described as an attempt by a faceless and disguised person who used the instrumentality of Voice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), both of Hausa service, to cause disaffection and generate bad blood in an already polarized Nigeria.
The group accused the unnamed person of claiming instances of lopsidedness in the recent postings of some Nigerian Police officers to command duties.
This was contained in a statement signed by the President of the group, Comrade Isa Tijjani at a press briefing in Abuja.
Using statistics and data to back their accusation, he said, “The allegations, as we have found out, are not correct in their entirety. Indeed, our view rather, is that the Police management, as currently led by Mr. Solomon Arase deserves our support and encouragement, to do more to change the negative perception of the police in the country and ensure adequate protection of lives and properties”.
According to the group, the allegations of lopsidedness which are predicated on the deployment of command Commissioners of Police in the six geo-political zones, deployment of Police Mobile Force (PMF) Squadron Commanders and the deployment of 2i/c Commanders of Special Protection Unit (SPU) were clearly falsified in the interview granted by the faceless and disguised person in question on both BBC and VOA.
According to the statement, the group also reminded both the VOA and BBC to keep with the requirements of best practices especially in a matter that is so touchy and important by ensuring that adequate verification and investigations are carried out to avoid disaffection in the country.
“As the hope and representatives of the Nigerian future, we are understandably always interested in what affects and shapes the prospects of unity and the corporate health of our dear Nation, Nigeria” , it added .
