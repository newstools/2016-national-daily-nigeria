THE Federal Government has convened a meeting of the National Research and Innovation Council (NRIC) with a view to making the agency to play crucial role in the planned diversification of the nation’s economy.
NRIC, which is Nigeria’s apex governing body for science, technology and innovation, is chaired by the president of the country, and consists of the key ministers and representatives of the organized private sector (OPS).
The council, which was established by the National Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy of 2012, was inaugurated in February 2014 by the Federal Executive Council, but never met.
Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, minister for science and technology, stated this during the NESG courtesy visit to the Ministry of Science and Technology in Abuja
According to Dr. Onu, the council has the mandate to set national priorities on research and development; set directions to coordinate science, technology and innovation in line with national priorities; and facilitate fund raising activities to support innovation activities in areas of national needs and priorities.
The minister also said that the council would focus on placing research and development at the heart of government’s economic diversification plan, how to re-energize import substitution, adding value to local materials locally, encouraging innovation, and linking research results to producers.
Onu, who met with a team from the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) in Abuja, also hinted that the Council would activate the much talked about National Science Research, Technology and Innovation Fund.
