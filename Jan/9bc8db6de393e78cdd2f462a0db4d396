It was the timely intervention of the Honourable Minister of Sports Barrister Solomon Dalung and security personnel that prevented what could have been a bloodshed between the President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick and the factional leader Chris Giwa who is fighting to get what he believed to be his mandate.
The duo exchanged blows at the parley organized by the Minister to settle once and for all the wrangling confronting Nigerian football. The event was held at the National Stadium on Wednesday.
The peace meeting began at exactly 3.50pm prompt after the Minister had breezed in at around 3.45pm while Giwa had arrived first at 3.02pm and NFF boss came in later at 3.08pm.
The scuffle started 1hr 15 minutes after the commencement of the meeting when Pinnick allegedly called Giwa a bastard.
The Minister then waded in to caution the NFF boss, asking Pinnick to withdraw that statement. “You were not supposed to use a foul language as a leader.”
Pinnick then apologised to Giwa. “I am very sorry Mr Giwa. I don’t know what got over me. I am ashamed of my actions. Please forgive me,” he said, and the meeting then continued.
