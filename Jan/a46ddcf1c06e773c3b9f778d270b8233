… Salutes the courage and gallantry of Bayelsa People
The national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Monday declared that rising from what took place in Bayelsa State on Saturday, it has become very clear that the APC-led Federal Government under the watch of President Muhammadu Buhari is not disposed to free, fair and credible electoral process in the country.
The PDP said this is worrisome considering the fact that President Buhari is a huge beneficiary of its electoral reforms.
Acting National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, who stated the position of the party while congratulating Governor Seriake Dickson for his well-deserved victory and for handling the situation in the face of provocations, also commended the people of Bayelsa State for standing against intimidation, rigging and violence to ensure that their will as a people prevailed in Saturday’s supplementary elections.
Secondus further said; “In fact, the steadfastness and resilience shown by the people, particularly in Southern Ijaw will go down in history as one of the many sacrifices made to defend democracy in the land.
“However, by standing against intimidation and remaining resilient, the people have greatly contributed in deepening democracy in the country and by so doing ensuring that their own destiny is right in their own hands.
“Bayelsa is a core PDP state and one wonders how APC thought it could win in this gubernatorial election with its discredited candidate, knowing the strength and popularity of our great party in the state, in addition to the record of achievements of our candidate, Governor Seriake Dickson,” he enthused.
The opposition PDP also decried the desperation of the APC which it accused of using thugs and some compromised security operatives to engaged in violence, resulting in the killing and maiming of innocent Bayelsans.
It therefore demanded a comprehensive inquest into the killings with a view to bring all perpetrators to book.
