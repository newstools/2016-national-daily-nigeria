Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors Forum on Wednesday night hailed the validation of Engr. David Umahi and Chief Nyesom Wike as the governors of Ebonyi and Rivers states, respectively.


The Supreme Court had earlier that day given final victory to the two PDP governors, thereby, sealing the hopes of Edward Nkwegu of the Labour Party in Ebonyi State and Daukoru Peterside of the APC in Rivers State to become governors.

The PDP governors said, after their caucus meeting in Abuja, that the two judgements by the Supreme Court amounted to victory for democracy. They, therefore, commended Umahi and Wike, saying that with their legal battles over, they would be better positioned to deliver democracy dividends to their people.


Ondo State Governor and Chairman of the forum, Olusegun Mimiko, read the communiqué issued after the meeting.

Also in  a statement by Chief Press Secretary Ebonyi Governor, Emma Anya, on Thursday, Governor Umahi welcomed the apex court’s judgement as the handiwork of God.


He said “it is God that is at work. God gave us a divine mandate and He has through the Supreme court made the path smooth for us to actualize the mandate; the mandate of providing the dividends of democracy to our people and making our dear state one of the best in this country.”
