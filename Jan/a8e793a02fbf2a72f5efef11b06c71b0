Nuhu Ribadu, EFCC pioneer chairman, has described as shocking the insinuation that he also got a slice of the $2.1 billion arms vote which former NSA Sambo Dasuki shared among friends, relatives, and PDP members.
“For the record, let me categorically state that I had nothing to do with the former NSA while he was in office. I cannot remember meeting him at any time while he held sway,’ Ribadu said in a press release Tuesday.
Rumours had it that the anti-corruption czar turned politician had made some refund to the EFCC after the commission reeled out 241 names of companies and organisations to which it has traced the arms fund. The agency also warned those not mentioned to come forward before push gets to shove.
“It is shocking for me to be accused of receiving something from someone I never had any relationship with, not to talk of refunding money he gave me,” Ribadu said, asking those making the allegations to come forward with documentary evidence.
He further stated that the office of the NSA has never contacted him, thus making it unnecessary for him to refund anything.
The arm scandal, now christened Dasukigate, has been flung far-afield, smearing a number of elder statesmen across political parties. Among those already connected, directly or indirectly, are SDP national chairman Olu Falae, Rivers former governor, Peter Odili, APC chieftain Jafaar Isa, Accord Party founder Rashid Ladoja, amongst others.
