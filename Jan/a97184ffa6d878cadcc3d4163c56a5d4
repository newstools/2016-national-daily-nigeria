Infiniti’s current flagship model, the Q50, has been prepped for 2016 year with the addition of several upgraded driving aids and a new and more powerful engine added into the option list. The Q50 hasn’t exactly been hitting its mark here in South Africa but internationally it is the brands top-selling model.
Entering the engine line-up is an all-new VR30 3,0-litre twin-turbo V6 which will deliver either 224 kW and 400 N.m of torque or 298 kW and 475 N.m of torque based on which spec is selected.
In terms of kit, the Q50 will now come equipped with an upgraded direct adaptive steering and dynamic digital suspension with the intention to make the Q50 more advanced and dynamic in order for it to appeal to the executive sedan segment. Upgrades have been made based on customer feedback and just over 1 000 000 km of testing.
Other minor tweaks to be found in the Q50 include transmission calibration, safety features and a premium plus package. The latter includes an electrically adjustable steering wheel with a memory function, easy entry functions, Infiniti InTouch with navigation and one year of InTouch services, navigation-synchronized adaptive shift control, electric lumbar support and a heated steering wheel.
With this in mind there is still very little talks about the GT-R powered 3,8-litre, twin-turbo V6 Q50 Eau Rouge and whether it will make it to production.
