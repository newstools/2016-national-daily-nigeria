The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria wishes to again, inform the general public that recent reports of recruitment exercise in the Authority, published in some sections of both the traditional and social media, are false and misleading. They should therefore be disregarded.
The last recruitment exercise in the Authority took place between March and May, 2015 to recruit officers into the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Service(ARFFS), Aviation Security(AVSEC) and Information  Communication Technology departments which had shortage of professional staff. The  exercise was concluded in May, 2015.
At the appropriate time, the Authority will invite successful candidates during that exercise, for mandatory training before deployment to various airports across the country.
We wish to emphasise that no recruitment exercise is taking place in FAAN at the moment. This is moreso because it has come to our notice that fraudulent recruitment agents and questionable recruitment websites are deceiving and in some cases, duping unsuspecting applicants by giving out misleading information about an ongoing recruitment exercise in FAAN.
Please, be informed that the only and authentic  website that belongs to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria
