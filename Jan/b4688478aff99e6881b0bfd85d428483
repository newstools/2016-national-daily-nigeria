NAN reports that in all, 37,187 .ng domain names activities were executed by the internet association in the year 2015.

It said that the availability of names is better on the .ng ccTLD than on the generic top-level domain (gTLD) like .com or .org.
“With the .ng, our primary Domain Name System (DNS) servers are secured and locally managed with multiple cast servers located around the world,” the statement explained.
It added that hosting businesses on the .ng would help to support the Nigerian economy and provide jobs for local Information Technology (IT) professionals.
