The Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE) on Sunday issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) over its failure to implement agreements reached.
The ultimatum is contained in a statement issued by Mr Ayeoribe Adelegan, the General Secretary of the Union.
The statement quoted Adelegan as saying the ultimatum commenced  from Jan. 29.
He stated that the critical agreement reached between the Union and the management  was the commencement of full implementation of the recently approved Condition of Service /Addendum for NIMET workers.
He added that the management had also failed to implement the effective date of 2013 Promotion and Mandatory Training for would-be retirees.
He also noted other contending issues to include the staff quarters occupied by officers who retired from NIMET and payment of 201 Ex-Gratia among others.
He indicated that “`unfortunately, the management and the ministry neither signed the agreement on the issues resolved nor implement items of the resolution.
“As a result of this, workers have become agitated, restive and have continued to protest against the management.
“The Union has no option than to give management a seven-day ultimatum commencing from Jan. 29, within which to resolve all outstanding issues raised and resolved at a meeting held on Dec. 16.
“Failure to comply, management should not hold the Union responsible for whatever action it may deem necessary to take.”
