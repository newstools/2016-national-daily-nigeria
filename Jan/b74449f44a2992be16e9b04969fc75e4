The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted dusty weather conditions over the central states of the country on Monday.
The predictions are contained in the Weather Outlook issued by NiMet’s Central Forecast Office (CFO) on Sunday in Abuja.
It added that there would be reduced visibility to 2 to 3 kilometres over Abuja, Minna, Bida, Nassarawa, and Makurdi with night time temperature ranges of between 13 to 20 degrees Celsius.
NiMet also predicted that the Southern cities of Lagos, Port Harcourt, Benin, Warri, Calabar, and Yenegoa would experience hazy conditions with visibility ranging from 3 to 5 kilometres during the forecast period.
It also predicted similar a situation for Ibadan, Osogbo, Ondo, Akure, Awka, Enugu, Owerri, and Onitsha with night time temperatures ranging from 15 to 22 degrees Celsius.
The NiMet report also predicted that the Northern cities of Maiduguri, Nguru, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, and Yelwa would experience reduction in visibility to about 2 to 3 kilometres.
The prediction also indicated that thick haze would result in visibility less than 1000 metres over some Northern states with night-time temperatures ranging from 10 to 17 degrees
Celsius.
According to NiMet, North-easterly wind from Sahara desert has continued to transport large quantity of dust particles which should lead to reduction in visibility across the country by tomorrow.
“During this period of the year, the atmosphere is usually very dry, windy, and dusty.
“Citizens should avoid substances that are easily flammable to reduce incidences of fire outbreak.
“Flight operations may be disrupted due to poor visibility in some airports across the country,’’ it said.
