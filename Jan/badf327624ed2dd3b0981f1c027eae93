Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Mrs Ibim Semenitari, said on Friday that the agency would be repositioned for better service delivery to communities in the area.
Semenitari disclosed this while addressing management and staff of the commission in Port Harcourt.
She urged staff to brace up for hard work to meet the needs of the people.
“We will ensure that we put the people of the region first. For that reason, we must make sure that contractors are not allowed to get away with shoddy jobs as we must insist on getting value for money spent on projects and programmes,” she said.
According to Semenitari, ensuring that contractors deliver quality jobs rests with the staff.
“ If we do our jobs well, contractors cannot get away with poor quality jobs; everyone should play his or her part.
“We will henceforth inspect projects before we pay contractors and only jobs verified and certified to be good will be paid for, ”she said.
The managing director urged the staff to follow service rules as she intended to work according to public service rules.
She said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration had set the ground rules that must be adhered to for the much-desired change in the country.
She said, “Those doing a good job will be rewarded and celebrated, but those who don’t do their jobs well should be ready to face the consequences.
“We need staff committed to the task of changing the Niger Delta region. Let us just do the right thing and it will work well for us,’’ she said.
