Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State on Sunday said the state would take its rightful place among major city states in the world in 2016.
Ambode said this in his welcome address at the 2016 annual thanksgiving service organised by the State Government, held at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja.
“Despite the bleak economic outlook predicted in many quarters for this year, Lagos State will grow in leaps and bounds.
“We are determined, and God willing, we shall achieve all-inclusive progress and prosperity,” he said.
Ambode said that the annual thanksgiving had become a tradition where people gather to seek the face of God for continuous peace and prosperity of the state.
“It is an acknowledgement of the overriding power of God to the affairs of men that there is need to trust in His grace and benevolence as a government and as a people, ” he said.
The governor commended all religious leaders for their prayers for the state.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that prayers were offered for the state by clerics at the event.
Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, and Bishop Mike Okonkwo of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission, among others, prayed for the progress of the state.
