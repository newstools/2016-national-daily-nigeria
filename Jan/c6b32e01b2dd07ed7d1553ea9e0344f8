FRONT line gubernatorial aspirant in Edo State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Major General Charles Ehigie Airhiavbere rtd, has been unanimously endorsed by APC youths drawn from the five local government areas that make up Edo Central.
The meeting at Irrua, Headquarters of Esan Central Local Government Area, where the youths took the decision, followed the positive responses General Airhiavbere gave in an interactive session with them.
The General, in a response to a question by one of their leaders, Comrade Felix Egberase, from Esan North East, told the Youths that if they supported his election as the APC candidate for the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state, he would put paid the issue of youth restiveness by creating jobs.
He said, “It is true, everyone will promise to eradicate unemployment but will be quick to accuse the system of not being able to fulfill that which they have promised; but I will assure you that I will not be like others reflecting on my training as a soldier. I have come to know that the only way we can achieve anything is through strong will”.
The youths who could not agree less with the General whom they described as a man of sincerity and sound mind who will indeed bring comfort to the Edo people, sang his praise.
Meanwhile, Major-general Charles Airhiavbere rtd, has described election or the struggle for power, anywhere in the world as war, adding that this is because it is an attempt to take-over power from an incumbent or establish new once.
He said, “It is a struggle for power and there are two-way…either you use arms or use the democratic process. Once you have a frame of mind that you are going to war then you prepare for it. And one of the best ways to prepare for War is to attack”.
