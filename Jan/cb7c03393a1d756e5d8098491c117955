The year seems to have started with a bang for talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres as her show has been renewed on NBC-owned stations until year 2020.
The 57-year-old will also be receiving the fourth annual People’s Choice Award for Favorite Humanitarian at this Wednesday’s show.

Speaking about the award, Ellen said: “I am so honored to be receiving the People’s Choice Humanitarian Award. I think it sums me up perfectly as I am both a human and an itarian.”

Ellen whose show has been the top-rated daytime talk show among women for the past four years since Oprah Winfrey’s run ended definitely has a lot to celebrate this new year.
