Gov. Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, on Saturday granted amnesty to Okon Akpan, a 64-year-old prison inmate, who had served in Ikot Ekpene prison for 25 years.
The governor granted freedom to the inmate under his power of prerogative of mercy during his visit to Ikot Ekpene medium security prisons.
Emmanuel, who charged Akpan to go and commit no more crime, stressed the need for proper upbringing of children through sound moral guidance to make good citizens. He also stressed the need for speedy dispensation of justice to reduce congestion in the prisons with the high number of inmates awaiting trial.
“My administration will continue to engage the youths meaningfully in vocational skills acquisition to reduce criminality,” he said. Emmanuel directed his Commissioner of Health to give prompt medical attention to two pregnant inmates in the prison.
He donated 100 bags of rice and three cows for the feeding of the inmates and commended the prison authorities for taking good care of inmates under their custody.
The Comptroller of Prisons in Akwa Ibom, Dr Regina Akpan, expressed appreciation to the governor for his magnanimity and benevolent disposition towards the inmates. She noted the harmonious relationship between the state’s Chief Executive and the Nigerian Prison Authority with the provision of a first-class Reform Centre. Akpan appealed to the governor to rehabilitate dilapidated structures and other infrastructure at Eket and Ikot Abasi prisons which she said, had large number of inmates awaiting trial.
