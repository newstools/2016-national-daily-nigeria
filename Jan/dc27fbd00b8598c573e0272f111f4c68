Barely four days after the lifeless body of Obi His Royal Highness (HRA) Agbogidi III Obi Ofolue Akaeze was found along the road dumped by his abductors after weeks of search, indications emerged today that the Delta State Police command and force headquarters Abuja have received no fewer than 120 save-our-soul messages attached with application for personal police protection by other traditional chiefs in the oil-rich Delta.
A senior police officer at the Delta police command confirmed the development to National Daily in an exclusive phone conversation this morning, when the reporter sought to confirm if the killers of the Ubulu-uku king has been arrested.
The source noted that top chiefs in the state are living in fear over the current spate of kidnapping targeted at high chiefs and other influential citizens within the state.
It noted that if urgent steps are not taken the kidnappers may extend their nefarious activities to other neighbouring states soon, a major reason why Abuja was quickly alerted.
The late king was kidnapped along Igbodo/Obior road two weeks ago, few days later his captors made demand of N200 million, and later reduced it to N100 million. The family in their effort to save the king life join hand with the community and well wishers to raise N100 million, took it to the point of collection as instructed by the kidnappers. But after long wait for days nobody came to collect the money which was in sack with foreign currency.
It was at this point it dawned on everyone that the king had been killed. This led to an intense search by the entire community, and the body of the king was found along Umunede road.
The community chiefs have vowed to use traditional method to expose the master mind of the dastardly act and punish him accordingly in line with Ubulu-uku tradition.
