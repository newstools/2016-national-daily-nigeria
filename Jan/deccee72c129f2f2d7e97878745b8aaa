The National Coordinator, the Youth in Agri-Business Development and Innovation (YABDI), Mr Adeniyi Sola-Bunmi has urged the Federal Government to maintain the ban on rice and poultry products in Lagos recently.
Sola-Bunmi reiterated that maintaining the ban on rice and poultry products will go a long way to encourage farmers to work hard to ensure the country’s sufficiency in those products, adding that ”Rice and poultry products were banned from being imported into the country.
He noted that when the ban was enacted, majority of farmers went into rice and poultry production and processing, adding that it is unfortunate that the ban was lifted through the land border which affected farmers negatively.
”Farmers are discouraged with this kind of inconsistency in government’s policy and l hope the government will look into this,”  Sola-Bunmi said, adding that past government (Akinwunmi Adesina) policy on agriculture created a lot of awareness and people became interested in farming.
The coordinator said that the fund allocated to agriculture in the 2016 budget by the Federal Government had demonstrated its willingness to promote agriculture and  that maintaining the ban on those products and some produce being produced locally would further enhance the nation’s stride towards food security.
