There is a growing excitement amongst athletes and users of the National Stadium, Lagos as renovation of the Swimming Pool continues after about two decades of neglect.
The rehabilitation of the swimming pool follows the facilities inspection tour of the minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung, and his insistence that the facility must come back to life by the end of the first quarter of the year.
Members of the sports community attribute the speed of works to the no-nonsense attitude of the sports minister in demonstration of his commitment to rehabilitating various national sports assets.
However, while some athletes are happy that the completion will provide enhanced platform for national swimmers, rekindle interest in the sports among the youth, enable regular competitions and also provide for public recreation, others have expressed uncertainty on the steadiness of funding and the assurance of better management and maintenance of the facility to avoid relapse.
