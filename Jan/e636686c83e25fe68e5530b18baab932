In a bid to lure its subscribers to the biometric revalidation exercise, MTN Nigeria has commence a massive campaign, giving the customers free airtime up to N10, 000, usable only when the full biometrics registration is confirmed by the network.
The subscribers on the network who have recently updated their data capturing and user’s profile are also receiving the Short Message Service (SMS) apart from new users on the network.
A subscriber on the network who craved anonymity told National Daily  that she received the SMS during the business hours of Wednesday January 6, 2016, adding, “…all most the people around me who are using the network got the message. I was happy when I got the message until I noticed that you have to update biometrics before you can use the credit. Well, I have to do it, because this is the first time I’m receiving such gift from MTN”.
Another subscriber, Oguntola Sunday said he also got a similar SMS shortly after updating his SIM registration through the verification of his BVN number.   “I got an SMS from MTN asking me to send Yes to 777 if I want them to use my BVN to validate my registration, although I was skeptical at first but I later did and my line which had earlier been blocked was opened, and I got this text: ‎”You have been compensated with 10, 000 valid for 7-days”
To make it easier for the customers, MTN, National Daily gathered has been creating new customers new registration centres at strategic locations in Lagos state in the bid to get closer to the subscribers.
The operator with over 65million subscribers is currently in legal fireworks with the industry regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for her failure to deactivate about 5.4million subscribers with incomplete SIM card registration.
With this massive campaign and incentives for subscribers, this is indicative of the fact that MTN is yet to reconcile their data with the government central database, while addressing the issues that incurred the wrath of NCC on them with record fine of N708 billion.
