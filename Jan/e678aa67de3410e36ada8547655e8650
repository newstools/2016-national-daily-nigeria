The Okerenkoko Federated Community (OFC), in Warri South-West Local Government Area of Delta, on Monday urged the Federal Government not to halt the ongoing project at the Maritime University in Okerenkoko.
Speaking in Warri, the OFC secretary, Mr Ernest Bebenimibo, appealed to the Federal Government to continue with the project started by the ex-president Goodluck Jonathan’s administration.
Bebenimibo noted that halting the project would amount to jeopardising the future of the Okerenkoko community.
According to him, the fears of the community arose from the alleged directive by the Minister of Transport, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, that works on the project should be stopped due to the ongoing probes.
“The stoppage of the ongoing project at the University permanent site is a pointer that work on the project had been cut short.
“The University is the answer to our quick development; it is the only visible gain of our Niger Delta struggle.
“To put an end to it will be damaging and inimical to our development, so we are pleading with the government to reverse its decision so that the project can go on.
“We are main contributors to the national wealth, the school is the only thing we have to show for the exploitation of our God-given resources,’’ he said.
Bebenimibo also called on the Federal Government to hasten the development of the community by providing them with good access roads to link up with the urban cities.
