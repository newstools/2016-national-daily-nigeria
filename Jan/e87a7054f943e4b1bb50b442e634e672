Two persons were claimed to have lost their lives in Aba, capital of Abia State, in a recent protest by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra demanding the release of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu.
It was gathered that the group marched through major roads in the city, chanting solidarity songs in support of the Director of Radio Biafra.
The protest, which took a violent twist after several warnings from security operatives, saw the group resisting the combine effort of the military and the state police to stop the blockage of major highways.  The Aba-Enugu expressway was blocked while bonfire was raised around Saint Micheal Road.
It was gathered that the soldiers tried all means to disperse them but they failed. Two persons were reportedly hit by stray bullets in the process of dispersing them.
Though the State Police Public Relations Officer, Onyeke Udevito has denied the casualties reported but affirmed the arrest of 26 of the protesters and that the combined team of military and Police only dispatched the protesters with tear gas.
The state police spokesperson has warned members of the pro-Biafran group to desist from further protest in the city while advising parents to keep their children out of trouble.
