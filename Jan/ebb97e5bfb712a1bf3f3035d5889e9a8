The price of kerosene has remained high in Calabar, Cross River, despite the Federal Government’s recent announcement of N83 per litre of the product, National Daily reports.
Investigations in parts of the Cross River capital on Sunday showed that the product was unavailable in most filling stations, including the NNPC mega station.
However, the product sold for between N100 and N120 per litre in the few filling stations where found.
Dealers dispensing from surface tanks as well as other black marketers sold a litre of the product between N130 and N150, depending on the area.
One of the dealers, Mrs Onwana Ubi, told reporter that she had not heard of the new official price of Kerosene.
“My selling price for the product depends on how much I bought it. I do not have any price option.
“I bought it N100 per litre from the filling station and I sell to my customers at N130 per litre. To me, this price is not too much,” she said.
A restaurant operator, Mrs Emilia Inyang, told NAN that she was more concerned about the availability of the product rather than the price.
“As far as Kerosene is available, I have no problem with the price; I will buy it at any amount,” she said.
