SUBSCRIBERS of the various telecom operators in the country have lamented the poor quality of services being rendered by these operators in recent times as pathetic.
The poor quality of services, subscribers said is not just the poor voice call service but also unsolicited SMS, poor data services and several others which they said were simply there to fleece the numerous subscribers.
Most subscribers on the MTN network, who spoke to National Daily, lamented that they were losing huge sums of money to the poor and unreliable services rendered by their Network provider; especially borrowing of airtime and data subscription.
They asserted that borrowing airtime on MTN network had become a dreadful gesture siting that whenever a subscriber borrows airtime credit, apart from the unfriendly 10 percent service charge deduction, balance cannot be assessed and the subscriber is sometimes double charged.
Okechukwu Duba bares his experience on the Etisalate network. ”The Text messages are usually very burdensome. It is their effort to sweet-talk the customers to fall into their antics. Some of these messages are from Fraud stars pushing job vacancies, artists, artisans and professionals selling their products which range from ring tunes, domestic to other social services for week or monthly charges. One will begin to wonder how private numbers that are supposed to be privy to only the service providers are being hacked into.”
Meanwhile, one of the customer service officers who claimed anonymous said some of the complaints by Subscribers are technical but the Sim registration is a directive of the NCC and it is strategic for security purposes.
