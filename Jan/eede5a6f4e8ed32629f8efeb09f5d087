The managing director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Engineer Saleh Dunoma, has said that work at the Port Harcourt International Airport is going on according to plan and the airport will become world best at completion.
Speaking to aviation journalists in his office on the pace of work in the aviation sector, Dunoma said work was ongoing at various airports across the country but that of Port Harcourt was faster.
He said the terminal will be completed before the end of the year
“Work on the terminals have gone far especially Port Harcourt, followed by Kano, Abuja and Lagos,” Dunoma said.
The FAAN boss advised passengers to bear with the Authority as a result of the inconvenience being encountered  due to work on the site adding that  they will soon start enjoying the services of the agency.
Dunoma said the management was making effort to ensure that airports were secured and safe for passengers, adding that the organisation was ready for the audit.
It would be recalled that the minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi and the Minister of State on Aviation, Hadi Sirika, inspected one of the new terminals under construction in Lagos during their visit where they assured that the terminal will be ready for use before December.
The aviation industry is presently preparing for ICAO audit coming up in March this year but Dunoma has assured that the country will scale through the audit.
