There was jubilation across Taraba following the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Abuja which upheld the election of Gov Darius Ishaku in April.
As the news filtered in that the governor won at the court, supporters in his home town, Takum and across other towns like Chanchanji, Wukari and Zing, took to the streets in celebration.
National Daily observed that there was no celebration of any kind in Jalingo as the town was very calm with people going about their normal businesses.
Reacting to the judgment, the state Commissioner for Environment, Mrs. Rebecca Manasseh, described it as victory for democracy and a new dawn for the people of Taraba.
Manasseh commended President Muhammadu Buhari for not interfering in the judgment and called on the people of the state not to over celebrate, but remain calm and law abiding.
Also a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy in the state, Mr. Emmanuel Bello in his reaction, congratulated the governor and the judiciary for coming of age.
Bello, who described the judgment as “victory for common sense”, called on the people of the state to support Ishaku to fulfill his campaign promises.
