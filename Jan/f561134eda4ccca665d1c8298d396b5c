The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted that more dust would be transported from the North to central states of Abuja, Minna, Nasarawa and Makurdi on Tuesday.
The predictions are contained in the Weather Outlook issued by NiMet’s Central Forecast Office (CFO) on Monday in Abuja.
It added that there would be reduced visibility of two to three kilometres and less than 1,000 metres over few locations with night time temperatures of between 10 and 18 degrees Celsius.
NiMet predicted that the Southern states of Lagos, Port Harcourt, Benin, Warri, Calabar and Yenegoa would experience dust haze with visibility ranging from three to five kilometres during the forecast period.
It also predicted that similar situation was predicted for Ibadan , Osogbo, Ondo, Akure, Awka, Enugu, Owerri and Onitsha with night time temperatures of 15 to 22 degrees Celsius.
NiMet predicted that Northern areas of Kano, Sokoto, Nguru, Kastina and Maiduguri would experience dust haze conditions with visibility between two and three kilometres and night time temperatures of 10 to 16 degrees Celsius.
According to the prediction, there is no indication of fresh dust particles coming into the country.
“The implication of this development is that slight improvement will be experience in the north while the central areas should expect moderate visibility.
“During this period of the year, the atmosphere is usually very dry, windy and dusty.
“Citizens should avoid substances that may ignite easily to reduce incidences of fire outbreaks,” it added.
