In a bid to curb road accidents in the country, the Zonal Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Ogun and Lagos States, Nseobong Akpabio, has warned motorists to desist henceforth because of the dangers associated with such trips.
Akpabio who made this known stated that eighty per cent of the accidents recorded during the yuletide season occurred at night.
He added that at least 110 drivers were arrested and tested with a device and found to be under the influence of alcohol.
“They were arraigned before a mobile court and were convicted for one offence or the other. Like I did promise, we will rid the roads of vehicles that are not road-worthy as well as reckless drivers.
Mr. Akpabio, an Assistant Corps Marshal, made this known while on his first official visit to Badagry as part of his oversight functions in all formations under his command.
He commended the outgoing Unit Commander of RS 2 1.1, Badagry, Salisu Galadancci and his officers for the renovation of their office, the handling of their vehicles, the cordial relationship that exists between them and the traditional rulers, youths and other agencies including the military which were represented by the Commanding Officers of 242, Recce Battalion, Ibereko and 15 Mechanised Brigade, Topo.
He said as from 1 April, 2016, the speed limit device for all commercial vehicles would take effect, adding that “the device is not just to regulate excessive speeding but it it helps to minimise fuel consumption.”
Pointing out that most big transport companies already has it installed in the vehicles, Akpabio called on Lagos State government to assist the agency with patrol vans, ambulances and towing vans.
Akpabio encouraged officers to further their education since the new Corps Marshall and Chief Executive has removed the embargo.
