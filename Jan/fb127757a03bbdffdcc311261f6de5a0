The Sokoto Zonal Office of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) said it constituted a three-man Task Force to enforce compliance with the new pump prices of petrol.
The State Controller, Mr Mohammed Makera, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Sokoto, Sokoto state.
He spoke on the compliance level by petroleum marketers in Sokoto to the new pump prices that came into effect on Jan.1, 2016..
Makera said that membership of the task force was drawn from the DPR, Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) and the Department of State Services (DSS).
“The task force is to monitor the sale of petroleum products, especially the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).
‘“The task force will also ensure that petrol is sold at the regulated price of N86.50 per litre by independent and major marketers .
“In the same vein, it will ensure that all NNPC mega stations and their affiliates sell petrol at N86.00 per litre,”’ he said.
Makera also said that the task force was set up sequel to a directive from the DPR head office in Abuja.
He described the level of compliance by the marketers in the state to the directive as “above average”.
He said that the daily fuel allocations to Sokoto State had now improved to about 10 trucks per day.
According to Makera the state requires an average of about 30 trucks of petrol per day.
“Motorists should exercise a little more patience as the Federal Government is doing everything humanly possible to stabilise the fuel supply situation across the country.
“The DPR will never waiver in ensuring that all the marketers fully comply with the new pump prices as well as in ensuring that motorists get value for their money,” Makera said
