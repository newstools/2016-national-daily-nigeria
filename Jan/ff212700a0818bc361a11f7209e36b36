Dr Dakuku Peterside, All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Rivers in the April 2015 election, says he has accepted the Supreme Court judgment which upheld Gov. Nyesom Wike`s election.
Peterside disclosed this on Friday in a phone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).
“ I thank God for giving me the opportunity to go this far.
“ The learned Justices of the Supreme Court of Nigeria have arrived at a decision, which was a clear departure from the earlier findings of the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal and Court of Appeal.
“ We accept the verdict. We magnify God for giving us the will to go thus far,“ he said.
Peterside, a former member of the House of Representatives (APC-Opobo/Nkoro Federal Constituency), thanked the people of the state for their support during and after the election.
According to him, the party fought for the good and interest of the state and not a selfish fight.
“ They know that we were not fighting for ourselves. We were fighting for the good and interest of all Rivers people and those who live in the state.
“ We urge all of them to take a cue from us and accept the verdict, same way we did and remain peaceful and keep trusting the Almighty God,“ he said.
Peterside said the party would work for peace and development of the state by being a vibrant opposition.
He urged the state government not to take it personal, any time the party criticises its policies and decisions.
“ Whenever he (Wike) needs our suggestions on issues, we will be readily available to offer it,“ he said
