The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Warri Zonal Office on Friday sealed five petrol stations in Warri and environs for various offences.
The stations were sealed for hoarding and over pricing of petroleum products.
The affected stations- Jaak Nig Ltd, Fomas Marine &Engineering Service Ltd and Conoil were punished for hoarding of fuel.
Also, Asolyn petrol station and St Luke Petroleum Ltd were shut for over pricing.
Addressing newsmen, Mr Goddy Agusa, Head, Public Affairs Division of DPR, Warri Zonal Office said it would be a continuous exercise.
“The exercise would be continuous until the people learnt to comply with government directive on the sales of fuel,’’ he said.
National Daily recalled that the Federal Government had ordered independent petroleum marketers to dispense fuel at N86.5 per litre.
However, many marketers had failed to heed the order.
Agusa said the offenders would pay fine to the Federal Government before they would be reopened for operations.
“Over pricing, hoarding and under dispensing attract N100,000, while double offence attracts N200,000.
“Normally, we are suppose to reopen them after two months, but with the situation around now, we will reopen them as soon as they remit their fines,’’ he said.
However, FrankChris petrol station in Otokutu, Udu Local Government Area of Delta earlier shut was reopened after paying the necessary fines.
Some of the motorists expressed joy at the exercise and urged the agency to keep it up.
