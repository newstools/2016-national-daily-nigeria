The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Plateau State has described the killing of an Abuja female preacher, Deaconess Eunice Olawale, as a setback to President Muhammadu Buhari’s peace efforts.

A statement signed by CAN State chairman, Soja Bewarang, said, “Given the efforts our president to strengthen peace and mutual co-existence in the country, an act by the ruthless killers of Eunice whose gospel message was not directed to any particular person is certainly aimed at abusing, frustrating and causing a setback to President Muhammadu Buhari’s peace efforts.”

Bewarang, while condemning what he described as deliberate attempt by some ungodly people to intimidate Christians from fulfilling their mission, stressed, “Everyday seems to bring worse news to our co-existence and freedom of public expression of our faith.”
