Jose Mourinho has directed Manchester United to sign France international Paul Pogba as a priority.
This has been reported by the Daily Record’s Duncan Castles, who has insisted that Mourinho recognises Pogba as the best option to change the dynamic of the midfield that he has inherited at Old Trafford.
Pogba, 23, previously left the Red Devils on a free transfer back in 2012 but has gone from strength-to-strength at Italian giants Juventus.
Indeed, it’s now believed that it will take a Premier League record bid from the United hierarchy to land the player they once had at their disposal.

In fact, Castles, who has a fine track record with all things Mourinho, claims that Juventus have set their asking price at a minimum of €80million.
Ultimately, then, it’s going to take something quite special from the club to be reunited with Pogba.
United, of course, have already secured the services of Ivory Coast international Eric Bailly and enigmatic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund have today confirmed that midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan is set to join the club.
The addition of Pogba really would prove quite the coup for Mourinho, who looks intent on helping the Red Devils back to the summit of the Premier League table sooner rather than later.
