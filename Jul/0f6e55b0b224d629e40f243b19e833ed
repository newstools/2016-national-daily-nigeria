A Federal High Court sitting in Owerri, Imo State capital, has upturned the forgery charges leveled against Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State.
Ikpeazu was cleared of forgery charges, saying his tax documents were genuine against allegation of forgery, adding that he remains governor.
Mr. Friday Nwosu, a governorship aspirant in 2014 under the PDP primaries had filed a tax forgery suit against Gov. Ikpeazu.

About two weeks ago, Justice Okon Abang of a Federal High Court in Abuja had sacked Ikpeazu as governor for submitting false information to his party, the PDP for the governorship primaries.
Justice Abang had also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission [INEC], to immediately issue a certificate of return to Uche Ogah, who polled the second highest number of votes in the primary. Ikpeazu has, however, since appealed the ruling.
