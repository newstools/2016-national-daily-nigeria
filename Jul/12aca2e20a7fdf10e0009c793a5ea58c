Indonesia has confirmed it will execute 14 people on death row for drug crimes in the coming days, including citizens of Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
UN human rights officials have expressed concern over the planned executions, urging Jakarta to put an end to “unjust” capital punishment.
The convicts will be executed at Nusakambangan prison island.
The prisoners have been notified of the plans for their executions, in accordance with Indonesian law, and could be put to death as early as Friday.
