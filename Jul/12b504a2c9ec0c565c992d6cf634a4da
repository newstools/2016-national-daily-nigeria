Momoh, who thanked the delegates for electing him, however, said that almost three decades after its establishment, The Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria had yet to earn its deserved respect among professional bodies in Nigeria.
“BON is like the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg but is not accorded its due respect,” he said.
He promised that the organization under his leadership would address the challenges bedeviling BON and “influence a new thinking, a new respect and a new vision for us all as professional broadcasters”.
