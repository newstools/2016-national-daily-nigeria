Banky W has had enough of ladies sending messages to him, claiming God made a revelation to them that he is their ‘Husband’. In multiple videos shared,he shared some absurd messages he got on instagram a while back, along with some candid advise for single people. According to him:
“If God tells you that somebody is your husband or wife, let God tell that person too. Don’t be the person to speak for God, let God speak for you. Recently I’ve been getting of lot of people saying “You’re my husband, God said I’m your wife”.. It’s a lie, Because God told me nothing about you, God needs to tell me himself.”

On Marriage shaming & his advice to single people, He said,
“Also can we please stop with the marriage shaming? Please, it’s enough. Single People. The same people who are putting pressure on you to marry will be the same talking about you and mocking you if the marriage fails. Don’t rush for anybody. Do it at the right time with the right person for you and everything will hopefully work out, by God’s grace.”
