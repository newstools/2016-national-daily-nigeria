The controversy between the Okoye twins who make up the Psquare music group seems to have finally come to an end as Peter Okoye took to his social media page on Instagram to release an official statement putting an end to the feud.




Recall that the quarrel had started over management issues with their brother Jude Enges and thereafter deteriorated further as both parties decided to go solo despite pleas from fans all around the world.
The latest development was however the disclaimer put forth by Mr. P over a show he claimed was booked in Psquare’s name but he wasn’t involved in.
Peter wrote on his page:

My dear fans, P-Square is back. Ours is a journey that started from our mother’s womb. It was a journey that started from Primary School, continued to St. Murumba College, to when we were in University in Abuja. It was a journey in which we shared childhood memories and grown-up dreams. We are back because brothers do not let each other wander in the dark alone. We are back because we have tried the lonely road and it was not the same.


ALSO SEE: Psquare has fallen!


I want to take responsibility for what has happened and sincerely apologise to you our fans. For supporting us throughout this journey we owed you so much more than what you have had to endure and I apologise for that. We are embarking now on a new journey with exciting new management, new music and new ideas.

We cannot thank you enough for all your prayers and support throughout this difficult period. Maya Angelou once said that brotherhood is a condition that people have to work at. We will continue to work on that and you can be prepared to be blown away by this new phase of P-Square.

God bless you all and be assured that you have not seen anything yet!

Peter Okoye.
