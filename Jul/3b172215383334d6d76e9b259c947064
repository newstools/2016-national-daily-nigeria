First Lady Aisha Buhari has sued Ekiti Governor Ayo Fayose and his media handlers for insisting she is the actual Aisha Buhari indicted in the Halliburton bribery scandal.
In the ex-parte motion, filed July 20, 2016,  Buhari prayed the Federal High Court, Abuja Division, to grant her reliefs to issue writ of summons against Fayose and his media advisers, Idowu Adelusi and Lere Olayinka.
In June, two ex-chairmen of the EFCC that investigated the scandal had cleared the air that the lady in question was not the first lady. The US authorities also made a statement in a daily that the first lady is not on the U.S wanted list.
However, Fayose and his lawyer Mike Ozhekhome still came out with a press release emphasising that the governor meant everything he said.

“Our client states and reaffirms categorically that the statement he made as regards the involvement of Mrs Aisha Buhari, the wife of President Buhari, in the Halliburton scandal, is correct and justified in law; having regards to a court judgement convicting one Mr William Jefferson for bribery in the Halliburton case,” Mr. Fayose’s lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, wrote last week.
Moreover, Fayose and Ozekhome apparently got the Halliburton scandal mixed up with the William Jefferson bribery case. Both were about a decade apart. The governor’s team would not admit their error, though.
The presiding judge, Olukayode Adeniyi,  granted all reliefs sought. Buhari, including an order of substituted service.
The judge also granted the prayer of Mary Ekpere, counsel to. Buhari, that the lawsuit to be served on Fayose and his two aides.
The service would be done through a courier service, DHL, or “by publication in the online media platform, namely PREMIUM TIMES with web page: www.premiumtimesng.com,” court filings seen by this newspaper say.
