“When I joined this organisation,there was someone in my role,I filled in a role that was existing, it is not as if its a new role,maybe the person resigned or was laid off,because if in an organisation for example,just giving an example,if someone is not performing,its possible the person is laid off,they were five in this department and we are still five even now,
“However, I am not the spokes person for the company,the spokes person who is my Director is not around so I wouldn’t want to be quoted,because I am not supposed to be speaking to the press on this issue,but I just have to come out to attend to you since my Director is not around,if they see my name in the newspaper now,it may not be okay”,Omijeh said.
Meanwhile, in a follow up response,he made available to our correspondent a recent company statement made in an engagement session with the Acting Head of Public Affairs and Communication, NBC Limited, Mrs Sade Morgan, ,who addressed the issue of Ilorin plant’s closure that may lend credence to any allegation of staff lay off which according to them is not true, saying instead,the Company is upgrading its manufacturing operations, and the Ilorin facility is being transformed to become a world class material handling and logistics hub.
The NBC Companys spokesperson further stated that, the restreaming of its operations in Ilorin is part of an on-going Accelerated Investment Plan, aimed at doubling production capacity by 2020, to better satisfy our customers and markets.
