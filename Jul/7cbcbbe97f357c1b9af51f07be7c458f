This morning another trailer carrying container fell off on the Ojuelegba bridge, fortunately, no one was hurt.
This is coming on the back of last year’s tragedy when a container fell off quashing a jeep and the family inside.
The lack of casualties was probably due to the fact that the container didn’t fall off the edge of the bridge as if this had happened there would probably have been fatalities as the area is always dense with traffic.
