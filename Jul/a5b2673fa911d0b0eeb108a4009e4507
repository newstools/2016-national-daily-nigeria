THE Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) says it has sealed off about 234 patent medicine shops in Oyo State.
Mrs. Anthonia Aruya, the Director, Inspection and Monitoring, told newsmen in Ibadan on Friday.
She said the council’s monitoring team sealed off the patent medicine shops in Ibadan, Iseyin, Oyo, Saki and Eruwa and Igboora for non-compliance with necessary regulations and directives.
“The shops were sealed off for non-compliance with to our regulations and directives by our monitoring team.

“The council is charged with the responsibility of regulating, controlling the education, training and practice of pharmacies in all aspects.
“It is the authority set up by law to register and license all premises where pharmaceutical activities are carried out among other functions,” she said.
Aruya said only people who had the required training and knowledge should be involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain.
The director, however, advised members of the public to buy drugs only from licensed medicine shops.
