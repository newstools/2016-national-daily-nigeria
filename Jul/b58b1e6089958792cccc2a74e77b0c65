Two boys and their mum on voyage en route from Libya to Europe sank after the raft they were travelling on, along with many others, turned belly-up on Friday.
The unidentified Nigerian boys, said to be aged 11 and 10, were, however, rescued by an NGO focusing on the plight of migrants struggling to reach Europe. But the kids lost their mother.
According to Dailymail which published the photograph taken by AP, the boys were among more than 100 migrants rescued by the NGO.
Over 3000 migrants have died in the course of reaching Europe across the Mediterranean in 2016. That is over 60 percent increase from the 2015 figure, according to another NGO.
