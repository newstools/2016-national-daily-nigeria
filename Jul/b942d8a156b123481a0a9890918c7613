The governor of Ekiti State Ayodele Fayose has said through his Special Adviser on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, in a series of tweets on Facebook under the hash tag ‘Fayose speaks’ that he has N300m in one of his Zenith account 9013074033.
Fayose, maintained that he deposited the said money as fixed deposit before he was sworn-in as governor and had declared it in his asset declaration form.
He, however criticised the EFCC allegation that he deposited the money in April 2015, six months after he had become governor.
Olayinka tweeted, “I declared in my assets declaration form that I had N300m in my fixed deposit account in Zenith Bank #Fayose Speaks.”
While substantiating that he never received campaign funds from the Office of the National Security Adviser in 2014, the governor said “I did not get money from the NSA Office to fund my election. It is just a conspiracy; it will fail like that of 2006.

The EFCC, which has since frozen the account had alleged that Fayose’s associate, Abiodun Agbele, allegedly received N1.219bn from the ONSA on behalf of Fayose and then paid part of the money into the governor’s current account and company account.
The commission had also alleged that Fayose personally moved N300m from the money and used it to open a fixed deposit account in April 2015.
The EFCC had said, “Abbey (Agbele) directed the bank to pay N137m into the account of Ayodele Fayose with number 1003126654 and Bank Verification Number 22338867502. The bank teller dated June 26, 2014, was filled by Abbey with teller number 0556814.
“Abbey directed the bank to transfer N118, 760, 000 to the same account and paid in N50m cash into Fayose’s account.”
