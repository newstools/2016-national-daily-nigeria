Muhammed Ibraheem Zakzaky, only surviving son of detained Shiite leader, Sheikh Zakzaky,  has raised alarm over the worsening health of his father who, he said, is going blind and crippled in detention.
The statement, signed by Shuaibu Isa Ahmad of the Academic Forum Islamic Movement in Nigeria (AFIMN],  contradicts earlier report by the DSS that the detained Shiite leader was in a very good condition, and that the security agency have spent N5 million Naira on his health.
“We are deeply concerned and worried about the present health condition of our leader Shaikh Zakzaky,’ the statement read in part.
‘Constitutionally, it is mandatory for the Nigerian state and those holding him to release him urgently and unconditionally to enable him seek for proper medical care in any place of his choice.
‘Since he has not committed any crime, he should be freed from this illegal detention, holding him hostage is unconstitutional, it is a clear violation of his basic rights and therefore unacceptable.’
