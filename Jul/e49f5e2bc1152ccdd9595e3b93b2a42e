Addressing National Daily in owerri, the NBA chairman Bar. Lawrence Nwakaeti said it is ilregal and quite unconstitutional for the present administration to destroy people’s property without given notice to the rightful owners and compensation.
He said the association is a vital instrument to defend the peoples’ right, adding that they have risen to the occasion to speak for the society especially, the voiceless and downtrodden.
