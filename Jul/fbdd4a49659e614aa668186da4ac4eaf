From CHRISTIANA EKPA, Lokoja
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that after due consultations with relevant stakeholders, it is set to conduct the repeat re-run national and state assemblies elections in Kogi State on the 23rd of this month.
The State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Samuel Madaki Usman, disclosed this at a press conference in Lokoja, saying that the exercise would take place in nine local government areas in the eastern axis of the state.
He narrated that the electoral umpire would conduct repeat re-run elections in the east senatorial district as well as state assembly polls for Ofu and Idah constituencies.

The REC, therefore, stressed the need for the stakeholders, especially, politicians and candidates, to eschew politics of bitterness by playing the game according to the rules.
Usman appealed: “without the full co-operation of stakeholders, it would be extremely difficult for us to deliver credible election, despite our determination to complete the exercise this time around.”
He assured the electorates that the lessons learnt from the previous exercises would be used to raise the bar during forthcoming polls, expressing the commitment of the INEC to meet global best practices.
While appealing to the media to support the commission in its direction, he reiterated that anybody without permanent voter’s card would not be allowed to exercise his franchise, and as such, should stay clear the polling centres.
