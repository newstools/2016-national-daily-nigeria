South African telecommunication giant, MTN has agreed to pay a fine of N333bn to the Federal Government of Nigeria.
The telecom giant disclosed this in a statement on Friday.
“MTN Nigeria has agreed to pay a total cash amount of 330 billion naira over three years,” the company said.
The company also said it would ensure the listing of its shares in the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
It will be recall that MTN was was slammed with the fine in October 2015 by the Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC.
The sanction was due to its refusal to comply with a directive to disconnect 5.1 million improperly registered lines before the deadline given to telecoms operators in the country.
