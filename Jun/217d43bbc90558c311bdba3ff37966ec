In a swift reaction, the Nigerian Prisons Service told Premium Times, an online newspaper that the suspected mastermind of the 2010 Independence Day bombings, Charles Okah, did not escape from Kuje Prison in Abuja, but was still in custody.
“It is not true that he escaped,” the spokesperson for the Nigerian Prisons Service, Francis Enobore, was quoted to have said.
He explained further that “He (Okah) is there (Kuje prison) hale and hearty. The comptroller of prisons in charge of the FCT was there less than 30 minutes ago and he saw him there. I spoke to the comptroller.”
Mr. Enobore actually admitted that there was an “incident” at the prison on Friday night but didn’t give details of what really transpired. He added that Okah was said not to be involved in the act, he reiterated.
