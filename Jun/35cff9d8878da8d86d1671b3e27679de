The House of Reps has yet to set up any panel almost a week after Rt. Hon Yakubu Dogara promised the U.S. Amb. James Entwistle the House would investigate three reps embroiled in a sex scandal in Cleveland.
The Speaker has even sided with the lawmakers by challenging the U.S. to first produce evidence to substantiate the sex allegation.
“Judgment can only be passed when an allegation is proven,” the Speaker said in a series of tweets weekend.
Apart from the absence of a panel, there are no hints yet about any on-going investigation, though the Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs Abdulrazak Namdas told journalists a probe was already on.

The House ethic committee naturally handles allegations of social misbehaviour among the reps. It is, perhaps, also waiting for a Dogara’s nod to go ahead and investigate the lawmakers.
However, Honourable Samuel Ikon, Mark Gbillah, and Mohammed Gololo will be addressing a press conference Monday to initiate their legal action against the U.S and Cleveland.
The three reps, Entwistle said in a letter to Dogara, the three lawmakers at the International Visitor Leadership Programme in Cleveland brought disrepute to the parliament by soliciting for sex and grabbing a hotel maid.
Gololo and Ikon are from the PDP representing Bauchi and Akwa Ibom respectively, while Gbillah is from the APC in Benue.
