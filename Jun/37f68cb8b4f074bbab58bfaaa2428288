English premier league club Everton have confirmed Ronald Koeman as their new manager on a three-year deal. The club will compensate the manager with about £5m as he leaves Premier League rivals Southampton after two years in charge.
Everton chairman Bill Kenwright confirmed the appointment. “We are really pleased to have secured the man who was our No.1 target from the moment we set out to appoint a new manager. “Ronald has such a strong track record in the game, instantly commanding respect for what he achieved as a player and for his qualities and accomplishments as a manager. “The hopes and aspirations that we all have as Evertonians are with him, as is our total support at Board, shareholder and fan level,” he said. Former coach Roberto Martinez was sacked by the club as a result of stringent runs of awful performances in the league at the just concluded season.
A deal with the Dutchman, headhunted by new owner Farhad Moshiri, was agreed earlier in the week and is reported to be worth about £6m a year. Koeman led the Saints to a seventh and sixth position respectively in his two year reign at Southampton.
