The founder of the world’s biggest Christian broadcasting network, Jan Crouch, died recently.
The Trinity Broadcasting Network tweeted Saturday that Crouch had suffered a significant stroke and tweeted Tuesday that “Jan Crouch, known around the world as Momma Jan, has gone home.” Her husband and co-founder, Paul Crouch, died in 2013 after a battle with degenerative heart disease. The couple started the California-based network in 1973 and built it into an empire, The Associated Press reported.
The prosperity gospel evangelized on the network promises that God offers material wealth to the faithful who sacrifice for their belief, according to the AP.

The Crouches’ children, Matt and Laurie Crouch, released a statement about their mother on the network’s site Tuesday.
“Laurie and I have just watched the transition of our precious Mother from this world to the next; watched her step into the presence of Jesus and into her heavenly reward,” it reads. “Jan Crouch, known around the world as Momma Jan, has gone home.”
