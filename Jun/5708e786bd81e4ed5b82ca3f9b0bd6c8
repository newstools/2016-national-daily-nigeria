Ethiopian Airlines is rewarding its Nigerian customers for being part of its success over 70 years. In April, the airline celebrated 70 years of flight operation around the world, and the management of the airline has decided to give out 50 free air tickets to Facebook users in Nigeria as a token of appreciation.
The General Manager of the airline, Solomon Begashaw, made this known in a chat with newsmen in Abuja last week.
Begashaw said: “Ethiopian Airlines has served Africa for the past 70 years. In April this year, we celebrated our 70 years. And as part of our celebrations, we are giving out 50 free tickets to Nigerians in the next 70 days.

“You must be resident in Nigeria to participate.”
Begashaw explained that the tickets would be given to the selected people to travel to tourist sites of any country of their choice in the world.
