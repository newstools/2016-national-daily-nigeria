TO define what the 2016 finance professional must look like, ACCA has developed a set of seven Professional Quotients a mix of technical knowledge, skills and abilities formed with interpersonal behaviours and qualities.
Toyin Ademola, ACCA Nigeria’s Country Head Intellect said that creativity, emotional intelligence, vision, experience, technical skills and a mastery of the digital world are seven key skill areas sought by employers now and in the future.
Speaking at the launch of the report, she said: “The accountant’s role has been revolutionised over the past decade, with finance professionals becoming leaders, trusted expert counsel and key strategic advisers to organisations whether in the public or private sectors.”

“With this metamorphosis comes a requirement for a whole new set of skills. On top of technical excellence, professional accountants now require creativity, emotional intelligence and the vision to lead,” She continued.
Ademola noted that the report stemmed from increased regulation in the global space, greater globalisation, ever increasing risk, as well as massive technological advancement.
She added that the accountancy profession has to be ahead of the curve on all fronts.
“Trained to the highest of professional standards, looking beyond the numbers and with a global mind set,” she said.
