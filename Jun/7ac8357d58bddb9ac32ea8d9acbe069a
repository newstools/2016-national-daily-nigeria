From CHRISTIANA EKPA, Lokoja
As part of his efforts to tackle the growing rate of kidnapping in Kogi State, the Federal Government has approved the deployment of Special Forces to the state to combat the menace and other related crimes in the state.
The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General  Tukur Buratai, who disclosed this in Lokoja when he paid an official  visit on the State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, said the Federal Government is worried over the increase in kidnapping and other crimes in the state.
According to him,  he was in the state on a working visit to the Army formation to see the challenges facing them and proffer solutions to them to enable the officers and men carry out their constitutional responsibility of contributing to internal security.
He said that the issue of incessant kidnapping and other security problems in the state has become a source of concern to the Federal Government.
“We are worried about the frequent kidnapping and robbery incidents in the state, and we therefore felt that attention should be shifted to the state in order to curtail the raising wave of criminal activities in the state, so that it will not degenerate into a worst situation.” he stated.
The State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello while thanking the Chief of Army Staff for finding time to visit the state said due to mountainous nature of some part of the state, it has become near impossible to root out the criminals from their hideouts.
He further disclosed that owing to the gate way nature of the state, armed robbers, cultists and terror groups displaced from the North-East and South-South find their ways to the state.
The Governor who called for more help from the Federal Government said he has initiated ‘Operation know your Neighbour ‘ in the state stressing that any strange face found within the neighborhood must be reported and failure to do so by the people in that area will attract serious legal sanction.
