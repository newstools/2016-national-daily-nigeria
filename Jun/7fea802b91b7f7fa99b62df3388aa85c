Emirates SkyCargo is strengthening its footprint in the Far East and Indian subcontinent with the launch of a new weekly freighter service from Hong Kong to Dubai via Delhi from 1st June 2016.
The new weekly service is being introduced to tap increasing cargo movements between Hong Kong, the world’s top cargo hub and Delhi, India’s busiest cargo hub.
Some of the key exports carried by Emirates SkyCargo from Hong Kong to India include pharmaceutical raw materials, electronics and machinery. From Delhi, Emirates SkyCargo connects customers to over 150 destinations around the world via its hub in Dubai.
Key exports from Delhi include leather goods, garments, pharmaceuticals and perishables.
In addition to providing businesses in both locations with increased opportunities to access new markets, the new service from Hong Kong to Delhi will facilitate growing trade flows between the Far East Asia and India. Emirates SkyCargo also operates freighter services twice a week from Shanghai to Mumbai and onwards to Dubai and 18 dedicated cargo flights from Hong Kong to Dubai.
Emirates SkyCargo will operate the service with a Boeing 777-F, providing 100 tonnes of cargo capacity with one of the widest main deck cargo doors to facilitate the uplifting of large cargo consignments.
EK 9219 departs Hong Kong every Wednesday at 2135hrs and arrives in Delhi on Thursday at 0045hrs. The service leaves Delhi on Thursday at 0315hrs and reaches Dubai the same morning at 0520hrs.
