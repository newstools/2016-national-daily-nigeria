Speaking on the feat, the bank said, as Nigeria’s leading financial institution with over 10 million customers, this achievement clearly aligns with its strategic intent to promote financial inclusion, support the cashless policy drive of the Central Bank of Nigeria and boost economic growth via e-payments across Nigeria and the African continent.
