British Airways has reiterated commitment to the Nigerian aviation market as it said that the country route remains its biggest business hub in Africa.
The airline, in a statement, debunked media reports that it was planning to stop operations to Nigeria over its $100 million trapped in the country.
It said that the airline was misrepresented by the media in some misguiding reports that it had concluded plans to exit the country, stressing that it was not true and the airline never issued any statement to the media indicating such.

The airline said it has a long history in Nigeria as it began operations in the country 80 years ago as Imperial Airways. It maintained that Nigeria remains a strategic market for the airline, adding that its operations locally are very strong.
“We have not issued any statements at any time indicating that we are on the verge of terminating operations in the country. We will continue daily operations into Nigeria,” the airline said.
