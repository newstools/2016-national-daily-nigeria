Reports have emerged that Popular music producer, Babatunde Okungbowa, popularly known as OJB  Jezreel , is dead, three years after a successful kidney transplant surgery in India.
He was said to have died early this morning, June 14, in a Lagos hospital, just one month to his 50th birthday. A family source claimed that his kidney transplant failed completely since last week. Recall that the producer was down with kidney related disease, and consequently was flown to India for a transplant in 2013. On October 21, the singer successfully underwent the surgery at the Indian hospital. After the successful surgery, OJB Jezreel , showered praises on his first wife, Mama J, for being there for him and donating one of her kidneys to save his life. While speaking after his arrival to the country from India, OJB revealed that despite discouragement from family and friends, his wife still made the crucial donation to save him, even at the risk of her life.

While describing his wife for the voluntary donation, OJB had this to say; “She is a wonderful person because it is one thing if God is telling you to do something but another to do it. It takes a lot of courage to actually do it. Just as Jesus had made the water for Peter to walk on, Peter needed a lot of courage to take that step and that was what she did at that dying minute. Even when the doctors came to tell her that they would have to cut her all the way to the back and would have to remove a rib so they could have access to the kidney, she still agreed to go through it. It takes courage to go through with it, so, I will say she is a courageous woman.”
