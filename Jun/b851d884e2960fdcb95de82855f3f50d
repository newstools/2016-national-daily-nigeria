After days of rumoured death, the former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, returned to the country after days in hospital in Germany.
He arrived Minna on Friday evening after undergoing medical treatment in Germany.
A statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Sani Bello of Niger, Malam Jibrin Ndace, said “Babangida arrived in Minna this evening.”

“He was accompanied by his son, Aminu, and daughter, Halima and other family friends.”
Gov. Bello decried social media reports that claimed that Babangida has died while receiving treatment.
He cautioned that “the media should be guided by the ethics of the profession. If you are not sure, don’t share.
The social media purported death of Gen. Babangida was reckless, unethical and unwarranted.”
