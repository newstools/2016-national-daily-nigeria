However, the Niger Delta Avengers had claimed that it was responsible for the attack on the Shell facility… the Forcados 48″ export line, explaining that the oil company refused to obey its warning against repairing its facility.
In reaction to the arrest, the Ijaw Youths Council, IYC, DoubraOkotete condemned the arrest of the community leaders, describing the action as “harassment, intimidation” of innocent people.
Okotete said that as far as he is concerned, the community were not Niger Delta Avengers.
