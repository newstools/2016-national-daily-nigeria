Barcelona legend Ronaldinho might have one of the fanciest footwork in football but he wouldn’t be using them to entertain in that manner anymore.
Ronaldinho Guacho will lace his boots (not football boots) to kick some ass in the latest installation of the Kickboxer series of films starring lead Jean-Claude Van Damme. The World Cup winner will make his on-screen debut in Kickboxer: Retaliation, in which he teaches Van Damme how to strike a lethal kick.
The former Barcelona and AC Milan forward will play an imprisoned martial artist called Ronaldo and he will be joined by other sport stars like Mike Tyson, UFC stars Fabricio Werdum and Paige VanZant, and Game of Thrones giant ‘The Mountain’ will also feature.
Ronaldinho is yet to retire from football with his last club being Fluminese who he left in 2015. Maybe its time for the football star to become an action movie hero…
