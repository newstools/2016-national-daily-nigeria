Former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman, Ali Modu Sheriff, has agreed to refund N40 million to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) after being invited by the agency, reports say.
The money is believed to have been Sheriff’s share of N24.29 billion allegedly distributed by former petroleum minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke to secure a re-election for ex-president, Goodluck Jonathan in 2015.

“Based on previous interactions with some leaders of the PDP in Borno State, we isolated issues for him and asked him to respond to the allegation that he benefited from the N450million allocated to the state by Diezani as campaign funds,” a source told The Nation.
“One of the issues was the N40million traced to him through Hon. Kumalia for security. Sheriff admitted receiving the cash and made a firm commitment to return it as soon as possible. Based on Sheriff’s pledge, he was granted an administrative bail,” he added.
Meanwhile, Diezani has denied reports that she stole money from Nigeria.
