He said that the outcome of the seminar would go a long way to serve as a veritable tool for assessing the hardware needs of the military and their procurement capacities while harmonizing them with the earlier proposed guidelines of the ministry of defence which is the supervising ministry of the armed forces.
The theme, of the seminar, ‘Capability Management of the Armed Forces of Nigeria through an Integrated Procurement System’, the CDS said the seminar would ensure that the operational requirements of the military would always be assessed with what the end users need.
“The theme derives its focus from global best practices where urgent operational requirements are matched with needs assessed from end users”, he said.
