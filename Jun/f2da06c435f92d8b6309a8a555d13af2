HONDA Motor Co. said at the weekend that it was recalling around 784,000 vehicles in Japan, part of an expanded recall for potentially deadly Takata Corp. airbags.
Honda said in Tokyo it was recalling models, including its Odyssey minivan, Fit subcompact model and Civic sedan with production dates ranging between 2003 and 2009 to replace passenger-side air bags.
Automakers are ramping up recalls after the auto parts maker, under pressure from the U.S. government, agreed last month to declare more of its airbags as defective in the U.S.
Takata’s airbag inflators can explode with excessive force in hot, humid conditions, and have been linked to more than 100 injuries and 13 deaths, mainly in the U.S.Honda’s recall is part of a push by Japanese authorities to make sure that Takata air bags without a drying agent are off the road by March 2019.
