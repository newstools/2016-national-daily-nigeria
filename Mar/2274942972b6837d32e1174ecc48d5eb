The Chief Speaker at the seminar and Founder of Agusto& Co, Bode Agusto, the discussion panelists, led by Head of Consumer Banking at the bank, Aishah Ahmad, agreed that investment opportunities abound in real estate, education, health and agricultural sectors of the economy.
They also pointed the huge investment opportunities in companies that are non-import dependent, critical sectors of the economy like electricity energy and FGN bonds especially as the borrowing level of the government to fund the budget is expected to rise. Agusto noted that the key prices in every economy include interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates and identified a fourth key price for Nigeria, the “the price of crude oil.”
He identified investment opportunities as listed equities with strong fundamentals and competitive valuations, private equity investments in education and healthcare and real estate. He argued that some people who used to go abroad for routine medical care and secondary education will look to local persons that can provide equally good service at competitive prices.
