The full weight of the law is being brought to bear as the Lagos State Government on Friday dragged the Managing Director of Lekki Gardens, Richard Nyong, and a contractor handling the collapsed storey building before an Ebute-Meta Magistrate Court in handcuffs.
Nyong and the contractor were in court today following the collapse of a five storey building at Ikate Elegushi , Chisco bus stop, Lekki Phase 2 that led to the death of 35 people on Tuesday.
The Lagos State Police Command had on Thursday confirmed the arrest of the Managing Director of Lekki Gardens alongside a contractor handling the project.

At the moment, no statement has been made by the government or the management of Lekki Gardens as the possible reason for the collapse of the building.
However, facts are beginning to emerge that low quality of building materials and sharp practices of the contractors handling the construction might have led to the disaster.
