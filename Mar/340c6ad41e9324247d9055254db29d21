The last has not been heard in the on-going probe into the arms deals as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has traced N1.5 billion to the son of a former Minister of Finance.
An operator of bureau de change, Salisu Umaru, who operates Jabama Ada Global Nigeria Limited, admitted that huge money was paid into his Zenith Bank account for the minister’s son but did not know what the money was meant for.
The former minister and his son were not named but the cash was believed to be part of the $2.1 billion arms deals for which the former National Security Adviser (NSA) is facing probe.
He said the money was paid into his company’s account, explaining that he never knew what the cash from the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) was meant for.
He said: “I was invited by EFCC and when I reported, I was shown my company’s account statement with Zenith Bank called  Jabama Ada Global Nigeria Limited in which there was an inflow of N500million on 5th February,  2015 and N1 billion on 16th April, 2015 into the account from the Office of the National Security Adviser.

“I also want to state that I do not know what the N1billion was meant for and what it was used for.”
