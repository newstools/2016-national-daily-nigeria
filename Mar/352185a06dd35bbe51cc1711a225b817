• Calls For Investigation of Abe, Uchendu, Peterside, Others
By NWADIKE UGOCHUKWU, Port Harcourt
THE Rivers State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has urged the State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike to ensure that all stolen funds belonging to Rivers people are recovered from the looters, and urgently consider putting all machinery in place for in-depth investigation into the activities of the former Secretary to the State Government (SSG) under Rotimi Amaechi, Mr Magnus Abe, former Managing Director of Risonpalm, Mr Andrew Uchendu, former Works Commissioner, Mr Dakuku Peterside and others.
The party Chairman, Bro Felix Obuah in a Statement in Port Harcourt appealed to the Governor to also implement the Rivers State Government White Paper which exposed massive looting and stealing of Rivers tax payers’ money under the administration of Mr Rotimi Amaechi with a view to recovering all stolen money to cushion the harsh effects of the empty treasury which Amaechi left behind and the slipshod economic policies of the All Progressives Congress, APC-led federal government.
The PDP regretted that under former Governor Rotimi Amaechi, officials of the government and Caretaker Committee Chairmen shamelessly and criminally shared amongst themselves loans meant for peasant farmers in the State.

Shamelessly, the same farmers the APC denied loans the Central Bank Nigeria of Nigeria, CBN, provided are same people they are approaching for votes, the PDP noted.
The PDP insists he who must come to equity, must come with clean hands.
The State Governor, the party strongly argued should investigate the activities of Magnus Abe, Andrew Uchendu, Dakuku Peterside and others to identify the roles they played directly or indirectly in the looting of the common wealth of Rivers people.
The PDP also admonished Magnus Abe, Andrew Uchendu, Dakuku Peterside and other APC chieftains to submit to such investigation to prove their innocence.
“The State will hardly recover and the people unhappy until those fingered in the mindless looting of the State resources go through the necessary investigation and prosecution, over the massive looting that characterized the administration of Amaechi and such loot recovered for the development of the State”, the PDP reasoned.
