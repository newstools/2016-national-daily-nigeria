According to Oscar N. Onyema, Chief Executive Officer, NSE and President African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA), the BAFM seminar is designed to promote growth in African financial markets, and presents an opportunity to enhance the capacity of African capital market participants and exchanges to compete effectively on the global stage.
“As African economies reposition themselves following the significant impact of global headwinds that have challenged the continent’s growth prospects, African securities exchanges must step up their efforts at driving liquidity in their markets in order to help finance the continent’s infrastructure and capital requirements. Initiatives such as this form an integral part of the continued development of sustainable economies within the continent bearing in mind peculiar strengths that we could leverage individually and collectively as we press forward.”
