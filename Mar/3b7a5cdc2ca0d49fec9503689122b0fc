Gwarzo said while most people identify capital markets as an important source of medium-to-long term capital flow, there is also an amazing potential of capital markets to serve as a catalyst for financial inclusion adding that going forward, the SEC will focus on massive public enlightenment and also stronger capacity building initiatives.
The SEC recently disclosed that its goal is to boost non-interest capital market product innovation so that the segment can be at least a quarter (25%) of the overall market capitalization.
