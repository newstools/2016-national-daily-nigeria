The Speaker of the Delta state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Monday Igbuya,has faulted the non proactive stance of the judiciary as the main cause of the gory tales which greeted the suspended River state re-run election.
Igbuya made the disclosure to newsmen, while on a courtesy call to his Lagos counterpart Rt. Hon Mudashiru Obasa,he noted that the bloodshed and arson that erupted in Rivers was avertable, if the cases had been dispensed with on time.
“Imagine if it were to a gubernatorial re-run, it would have been much more terrible, because the palpable fear that enveloped the place was occasioned by the resolve of the political gladiators to massage their ego and affirm their supremacy.

“The judiciary is the root cause of the imbroglio, because if the various litigations were earlier dispensed with in the court of competent jurisdiction, each of the actors concerned won’t have been that vengeful and we won’t have this sad tales”. Igbuya affirmed”.
Commenting on his experience at the Lagos Assembly’s plenary, even though an unofficial visit,Igbuya was full of commendations, noting that the house had a matured conduct,he stressed that an independent legislature remains the pivot of any democracy from all reckoning.
He however dispel the rumour making the rounds that he was poised to aspire for the state Governor’s position come 2023,”the report did not emanate from me, but from my detractors, the Governor is quite experienced, having being a legislator prior to becoming a Governor, so he is tune with governance and i have no reservations for his performance so far, i am even vouching for him to return 2019, by the grace of God because of the quality he possess and the delivery of good governance thus far witnessed in our state”.
