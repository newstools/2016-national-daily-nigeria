A football fan of Zamalek and trainee pharmacist, Ahmed M.Yousry, from Egypt, is pleading with Nigerian Football Federation to call up Maarouf Youssef to play for the Super Eagle.
The 22-year-old Youssef is one of Nigerian midfielders in Egypt, and he had been playing for ELshorta since he was 18. He was signed on to Zamalek in 2014 when he helped in winning the league, the Egyptian Cup, and reaching the semi-final in the African Confederation Cup.
