President Muhammadu Buhari has flung out no fewer than 184 budget officials involved in the 2016 budget padding whose scandal rubbished the anti-corruption campaign of the current administration.
Buhari delivered the blow Thursday, and 22 of those who took the hit were from the top-level functions in the budget office, including four directors, six deputy directors, and 12 assistant directors.

Others were from the budget offices of ministries, departments, and agencies of the federal government.
They have been redeployed to departments that have nothing to do with budgeting, and 14 tested hands have been brought in to replace them.
To make the punishment tougher, the president further merged the budget office with the ministry of national planning.
Buhari’s action is in fulfilment of his threat to deal with those who manipulated the N6.08 trillion budget proposal he presented last December to the National Assembly.
All the affected officers, according to Akpandem James, media adviser to the budget office, are to report in their new locations on or before the close of work Friday.
