The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) sealed up the NNPC petrol station for illegaly hoarding fuel and denying customers the right of purchase in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state.
DPR Operation Controller in Akwa Ibom and Cross River states, Bassey Nkanga, said the mega station had stocked the petroleum products in its storage tanks, refusing to sell it to members of the public.
“The fuel scarcity is not experienced only in Akwa Ibom, it is a national problem. Yesterday, we got two trucks of the product for Uyo. We are monitoring the sale of the product to see if there will be any illegality,” Nkanga said.

According to Mr Nkanga, despite the state is experiencing crippling fuel scarcity, the situation is rather unusual for the area. He called on the residents of the states to stay patient as the government exert every effort to adress the problem.

It is still unknown whether DPR will impose any fine on the owners of the petrol filling station or just reprimand them. Meanwhile, Ibe Kachikwu, the minister of state for petroleum resources, has apologized to Nigerians for endless queues at filling stations across the country and promised that the current fuel scarcity will be over in the next few days.
