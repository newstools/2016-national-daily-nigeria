SPECTRANET 4G LTE, internet service provider (ISP), has announced a unified tariff plans part of its effort to ensure everyone has access to affordable and faster internet.
This new development comes with an additional10GB bonus for renewals before 30th June and unlimited free night browsing from 1am to 7am for Spectranet subscribers across the country.
Mike Ogor, head of Marketing, said “the unified and revised plans simply means all Spectranet subscribers across the country can now enjoy the same data plan as against the previous tariff where what went for Lagos was not applicable to Port-Harcourt and other cities”.
He said, “Spectranet is a customer oriented brand and that is why they connect customers to what matters to them. For us, the decision to have a unified tariff is expedient. The unified tariff is another way of telling our subscribers that they matter to us. With Spectra net’s unified tariff the same data plan you buy in Lagos is what you will get across all the states of the country where we have Spectranet services”.
He added that ”when a customer buys data ranging from 20GB to 200GB each customer is automatically entitled to an extra10GB monthly and unlimited free night browsing and this will go a long way in helping customer connects to what matters to them”.
Ogor stated that Spectranet has improved its service to enhance seamless video streaming as streaming videos online require a fast internet connection.
