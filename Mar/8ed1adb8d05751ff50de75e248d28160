HONDA Motor Southern Africa has expanded its recall campaign to replace Takata supplied airbag inflators.
Honda is currently in the process of contacting owners of affected vehicles but they would also like to encourage Honda customers to access their website, where they can utilise the VIN-checker to confirm whether their vehicle is affected and also confirm/amend their contact details.

The recall campaign will be conducted in phases. Replacement components are currently being sourced, following receipt of which, owners will be contacted by Honda Motor Southern Africa to make an appointment with their dealer for replacement of the airbag module(s). The replacement will take between one and two hours at no cost to the owner.
To date, no incidents involving defective inflators have been reported in the South African market. There is no risk that the driver or passenger airbag fitted to your vehicle may deploy unintentionally and that this concern may only be exhibited in the event that the vehicle is involved in an impact sufficient to deploy the vehicle’s airbags.
