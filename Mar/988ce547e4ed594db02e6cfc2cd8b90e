Prof. Angwe who was visibly angry over the reported shooting of the student is using this medium to call on the Inspection General of the Police, Mr. Solomon Arase to intensify their intervention to ensure that the Police Officer involved in the killing of the student was prosecuted in line with the relevant laws.
The Executive Secretary called on Officers and men of the Police Force to always abide by the rules of engagement while on duty, “saying human life is sacred and no amount of provocation can justify the killing of any human being”.
He assured Nigerians that everything would be done to ensure that the culprit is brought to book.
