Assistant head coach of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club of Lagos, Alli Suleman Obinna has declared that Kano Pillars football club will fall in Lagos on Wednesday in Match Day 8 of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) tie involving the two sides.
The Agege Stadium will witness yet another interesting and entertain top flight action as the Olukoya Boys go head to head with four times league champions, the Sai Masu Gida but coach Alli believes the visitors will fail.
He began”Kano Pillars are a very good team, they’ve been in the league before us, you know we just came back from Owerri where we lost to Heartland fc, I strongly believe we are not going to lose two matches in a row. On Wednesday, by the special grace of God, Kano Pillars will fall and we will claim the three points.

The Lagos-based team is second on the NPFL table with 13points from 7 league games while the visitors occupy the third spot on the log with 11 points. A win for MFM will take them to the league summit again.
