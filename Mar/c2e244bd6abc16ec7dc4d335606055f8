The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) have called off their strike with immediate effect.
The nationwide strike occasioned by the government unbundling of the NNPC ended after a long meeting between the minister of state for petroleum, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, and the unions
Kachikwu, who doubles as the Group Managing Director of NNPC, explained that what the oil corporation did was “reorganization,” which will split the corporation into restructuring that five divisions.
The unions have now resolved to work with the NNPC as long as its workers were not affected in the unbundling.
According to a statement by the unions, a resolution was signed by the two parties which ended the industrial action.
The unions shut their offices nationwide for two days, leading to fuel scarcity that gave rise to queues in fuelling stations in Lagos and other states across Nigeria.
