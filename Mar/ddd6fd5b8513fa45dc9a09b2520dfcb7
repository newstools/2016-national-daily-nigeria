ACCESS Bank Plc has posted its full year financial result for the year ended December 31, 2015, recording 38 and 53 per cents increase in its gross earnings and profit after tax (PAT).
The bank, in its result released on the Nigerian Stock Exchange yesterday, posted a gross earning of N337.4 billion as against the N245.4 billion which it recorded in the comparable period of 2014.
Interest income and non-interest income contributed 62 and 38 per cents respectively to the bank’s earnings in 2015 as interest income grew year-on-year by 17 per cent to N207.8 billion from N176.9 billion while non-interest income stood at N129.4 billion, up 89 per cent from N68.4 billion.
The increase in non-interest income, the bank said, is attributable to strong gains on foreign exchange trading income “which reflects management’s ability to diversify the bank’s revenue sources.”
Profit before tax (PBT) for the period rose to N75 billion, representing a 44 per cent growth when compared to the N52 billion which it recorded in 2014 while PAT rose to N65.9 billion from the N43.1 which it made in 2014.

We achieved strong financial progress in 2015 as the group recorded a 44 per cent growth in PBT to N75 billion from N52 billion in 2014, with significant contribution from our securities trading business.
“Guided by a robust risk management framework, our diversified business model yielded positive results as we grew the business cautiously and recorded sound prudential ratios. During the year, we successfully raised capital by way of rights issue which has significantly strengthened our capital base and now provides us with sufficient headroom to harness opportunities in key growth sectors of the economy.
“In the coming year, we will remain resilient in the execution of our bold strategy for increased growth and profitability. Though market conditions will remain challenging, we will focus on innovation, proactive risk management and data analytics as catalysts for diversifying income streams and enhancing retail expansion so as to maximise shareholder value in 2016 and beyond,” he stated.
