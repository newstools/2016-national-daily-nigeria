EKITI State Government has disbursed a sum of N447, 410,000 (Four hundred and forty-seven million, four hundred and ten thousand Naira) as housing, land and vehicle loans to 1,885 workers in the state Public Service.
Speaking at a forum in Ado Ekiti, the state Head of Service, Dr. Olugbenga Faseluka said the loans were aimed at cushioning the effect of the current economic recession on the workers whom he said are investing their productive time working for the development of the State.
Dr Faseluka explained that N210, 550,000 was disbursed as housing and land loans to 1,112 beneficiaries between October 2014 and January 2016 while N236, 860,000 is currently being disbursed by the Office of the States Accountant-General to 773 beneficiaries after proper screening and ensuring that they do not take more loans than their individual salary could service.
The Head of Service who described the welfare packages as morale boosters for workers said the regular disbursement of the loans was in line with the commitment of Governor Ayo Fayose to the welfare of workers; saying that the present administration in Ekiti State had continuously funded the scheme to provide succor to workers.
Faseluka commended Governor Fayose for giving premium to workers welfare in spite of the financial crunch which the State was facing; adding that the governor had demonstrated that he was truly worker-friendly.
The Head of Service added that the loan would help reduce the financial stress which some workers are experiencing as a result of commercial bank loans.
