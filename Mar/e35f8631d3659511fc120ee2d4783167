From NOSA ERESOYEN, Asaba
THE National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on Thursday raided the popular Igbudu Market in Warri, Delta State.
The enforcement exercise embarked upon by NAFDAC in Warri, affected over ten shops who were storing fake products, expired products and others without NAFDAC number.
Mr. Idowu Joseph, NAFDAC chief regulatory officer and environment operations told our correspondent that the recovered drinks were suspected to be fake, some with tampered dates, expired and without NAFDAC Numbers.

He said that the items were recovered from over ten shops, adding that they were consequently sealed.
He said: “The samples of the products would be taken to Asaba for laboratory analysis to ascertain its genuineness, while the defaulters would be interrogated and possibly prosecuted”.
According to the NAFDAC Officer, the defaulters will be made to face the wrath of the law because some of them actually know that the products were fake, yet they put them on sale.
Some of the affected traders who spoke to our correspondent said they were not aware that the products were fake, just as they promised to turn a new leaf if they overcome their present challenges.
