The era of abduction of school girls as ingeniously carried out in the northeast by Boko Haram terrorists when they abducted over 200 students at Chibok village among others is being repeated in Lagos by an unknown armed gang.
On Monday night, a gang of armed robbers stormed a seminary of the Anglican Communion, Babington Macaulay Junior Seminary (BMJS) in Ikorodu, Lagos State, and abducted three female students without trace yet.
Although the actual number of the girls captured is still a subject of intense debate, the Police is insisting that the number of students taken away by the gang was three against insinuations that they were more than that figure.
