The Commodities Brokers Association of Nigeria,President, Alhaji AltineKajiji, has urged the Federal Government not to withdraw subsidy on fertiliser in an interview in Abuja yesterday.
Kajiji said that Nigerians would be discouraged from farming if subsidy on fertiliser was removed, adding that farmers in the country toiled without commensurate gains.
He who explained that people are being given subsidy on fertiliser to be able to farm everywhere in the world, stresses that the government should remove subsidy.
Kajiji noted that farming is where majority of jobs are provided for citizens and that is where we can have food security, especially now that infrastructure and other incentives are not available and added that the proposed Bill for the establishment of Chartered Institute of Export and Commodity Brokers of Nigeria would provide platform to attract foreign markets for agricultural produce.

Kajijiwho expressed the hope that the bill would also encourage farmers to meet the standard of products demanded by local and foreign customers, added that with this, farmers will have the latitude to sell produce and maximise profit because there is a medium where brokers will be able to get buyers for him.
It should be of note that at the recent House of Representatives’ Committee on Commerce organised a public hearing on the bill, speaker of the House, MrYakubuDogara, said there was need to strengthen commerce by creating a better environment for business to thrive in the country.
Dogara said that the public hearing seeks to create and strengthen the enabling environment that would facilitate the process involved in the production and distribution of goods and services.
