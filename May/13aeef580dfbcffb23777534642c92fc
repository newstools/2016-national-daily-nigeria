THE Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has unveiled its proposed licensing framework for the 38GHz and 42GHz bands as well as the re-planning of the 23GHz Microwave spectrum band for improved telecommunications services in Nigeria.
Speaking at a consultative forum in Lagos to seek the input of stakeholders on the licensing framework, the Executive Vice Chairman, EVC, of the NCC, Professor Umar Danbatta said that “the Commission as a matter of tradition institutionalized a policy of participatory regulation and industry wide consultations in carrying out its regulatory functions”.
The forum on the 38GHz and 42GHz licensing framework as well as the re-planning of the 23GHz Microwave spectrum band the EVC added, is consistent with the commission’s 8-point agenda to facilitate strategic collaboration and partnership with relevant stakeholders to improve Quality of Service, facilitate broadband penetration, optimize usage and benefits of spectrum, protect and empower consumers, promote innovation and investment opportunities, promote fair competition and ensure regulatory excellence and operational efficiency.

The EVC who was represented by the Director, Public Affairs of the Commission, Mr. Tony Ojobo, further added that due to the emerging broadband trend in the Nigeria telecommunications market today, which will certainly require massive deployments of critical infrastructure, this forum has become imperative “if we are to achieve the set target of government of 30 per cent broadband penetration by 2018 where additional spectrum resources would be required to avoid network challenges. The opening up of 38 and 42GHz bands for use in Nigeria and the re-planning of the 23GHz Microwave spectrum band is one of such measures”
“The commission recognizes that it is important to review the channeling plan in some of the existing Microwave Frequency bands as well as to open up and license other Frequency bands that are commercially viable to enable efficient use of spectrum which will also enable the operators of the industry to effectively meet their spectrum needs for rollout of broadband services”.
According to the EVC, the licensing will help the telecoms industry to: Address the growing demands by operators for spectrum for high speed and high capacity links for data centric services Further assist the commission’s drive for National Broadband Wireless Access Initiative Reduce the pressure and management challenges experienced with the traditional Microwave Frequency bands.
All these he added is to enable ubiquitous and pervasive broadband services which the commission foresees that the Nigerian consumer can leverage on and this will also make service delivery better.
