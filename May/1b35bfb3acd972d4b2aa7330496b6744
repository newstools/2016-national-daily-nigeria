IN furtherance of the ongoing efforts to enhance operational effectiveness and service delivery, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has commissioned new sets of facilities in its units at Makurdi and Benin City. Some of the newly commissioned projects were named after deceased personnel who died in the ongoing counterinsurgency operation in Northeast Nigeria. Those honoured with the recent projects are Flight Lieutenant Ebitimi Owei and Flight Sergeant Awodi Emmanuel Adakole who died on 10 October 2015 and 25 August 2015 respectively.
The newly provided facilities in Makurdi include a Bulk Fuel Installation (BFI) with 2,000,000 litres capacity, crew/briefing room for F-7Ni pilots, 12 units of 3-bedroom flats for Senior Non-Commissioned Officers, and sporting facilities for the use of NAF personnel, family members and host community. Also, a block of 4 units of 3-bedroom flats was commissioned for officers serving at the 81 Air Maritime Group, Benin.
Meanwhile, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar has called on the beneficiaries of the new facilities to reciprocate the gesture by the Federal Government, who made the necessary funds available for the projects, by rededicating themselves to their duties. Air Marshal Abubakar reminded the personnel that “the whole essence of government’s commitment to their welfare is to bring out the best in them”. He therefore urged them to remain selfless and committed in the pursuit of their assigned statutory duties”. The CAS was represented at both occasions by the Chief of Policy and Plans, Air Vice Marshal James Gbum.
