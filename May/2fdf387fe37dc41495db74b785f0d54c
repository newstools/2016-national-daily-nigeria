The Nigerian military high command has disassociated itself from the report of Amnesty International which claimed that some civilians died in a detention cell at Giwa Barracks.
It further stated that the accusation against the military comes as a surprise especially as the organisation accessed the facilities and made recommendations which were implemented.
In a statement in Abuja on Thursday, the Director, Defence Information (DDI) Brig Gen Rabe Abubakar said that “It is rather unfortunate that an organization of higher repute such as Amnesty International could come around to release a report which is completely baseless, unfounded and source-less with the intent of denting the image of the Nigerian Armed Forces.

“We will not be deterred by this report, but would remain committed to the task we have started against the Boko Haram terrorists until they are annihilated,” Gen Abubakar added.
He called on Nigerians as well as the International Communities to discountenance the report as it has no iota of truth. He reiterated that the Nigerian Armed Forces would uphold the tenets of observance of human right and dignity of lives of innocent individuals as enshrined in the Conventions and Charters of the United Nation which Nigeria is a signatory.
He berated the international body for misinforming the publics through its “one-sided report” describing it as “defective in all intent and purpose and does not portray the sincerity of Amnesty International as well as  reflecting the true situation in Giwa Barracks at the moment.”
