KADUNA State Governor, Mallam Nasir-El-Rufai, has identified the need for states-own enterprises (SOEs) in Nigeria to enshrine Corporate Governance as essential policy for their transformation and competitiveness.

According to him, by creating more transparent and economically viable SOEs to be privatised or that have been privatised, Corporate Governance would ensure actual service delivery to the public which would guarantee the public or consumers value for their money.

The Governor said the convergence of the global economy towards market based systems has elevated the concept of Corporate Governance to a new height and this has brought pressure to bear on the modern day corporations around the world to comply with international best practices and standards.
“It is becoming increasingly recognised that companies should be managed efficiently following prudential guidelines to protect the interests of stake holders rather than promoting insider abuse. Nigerian companies are not exempted from this Global trend.”
The Kaduna Governor maintained that the broader view of corporate governance, as a set of mechanisms which deals with institutional reforms beyond just company-level changes, suggests that it is one of the integral components of successful development strategies. He said Corporate Governance is fundamentally central to building competitive economies, reducing corruption, promoting property rights, and creating jobs and wealth all of which are components of successful poverty alleviation efforts.
