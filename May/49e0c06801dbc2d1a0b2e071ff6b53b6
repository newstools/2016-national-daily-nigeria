The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has obtained a remand order to keep Femi Fani-Kayode, in custody for the next two weeks.
The remand order is, however, renewable after 14 days depending on the outcome of investigations.
Fani-Kayode is being investigated by the EFCC for allegedly receiving N840 million when he was the Director of Publicity for the Goodluck Jonathan Campaign Organisation in 2015.

The money, which Fani-Kayode confessed to receiving, was said to have emanated from the account of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
The commission had recently frozen the ex-minister’s Zenith Bank account with number 1004735721 domiciled at Maitama, Abuja.
