The Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Barrister Uchenna Orji, speaking during the forum said that the summit was convened to deliberate on how to revolutionize rice production in the state for greater yield and emphasized during a separate interview with Journalist that the Ebonyi State Government has mandated each public office holder in the State to cultivate at least five hectares of rice in the 2016 farming season.
The Commissioner who stated that the Governor wants its officials to lead by example in realising its objective on massive rice production to buttress the seriousness attached to it, stressed that officers must show manifest interest in rice cultivation as they were expected to own lands and possess certified proof of ownership from the state’s Ministry of Lands and Survey.
He also said that interested individuals must also show the extent they will go in the cultivation process, evidence of farm-management knowledge, among other requirements, adding that individuals need to support government in realising this objective, as it is battling to meet the requirements of other sectors in the face of harsh economic realities.
The commissioner added that interested farmers will sign necessary agreements with government and be ready to commence cultivation in the next one week, as he disclosed that the State Government also gave N200 million loan to Ebonyi Rice World Company to mop sufficient rice paddy for intended purpose.
