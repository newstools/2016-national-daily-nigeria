Less than a month after the death of the music icon Prince his siblings are already in disagreement with the arrangement concerning how to get money from his clients.
According to TMZ reports, Prince’s 6 siblings are competing for ways to quickly get cash out of his death through TV package, with major music producers and famous artists who will perform Prince songs for a 2 hour TV special set to air in August.
The conflict is they are trying to organise and co-produce with the aim of getting boxed up with some dough pending when the bank running the estate figures out how to dole out the main cash.
However, one of Prince’s sibling Tyka is not gamed with the whole plan, she wants to produce and control her own TV special.
