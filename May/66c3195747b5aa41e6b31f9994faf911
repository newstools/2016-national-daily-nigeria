From DAPO SALAMI, Ibadan
OYO State Coordinator of Oodua people’s congress (OPC), Comrade Rotimi Olumo has come on strongly against Fulani herdsmen who are attacking innocent farmers, leaving many dead and farmlands devastated.
Speaking with National Daily Correspondent in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, he said it is high time government at all levels call them to order.
Comrade Olumo wondered why the herdsmen were allowed to have a field day, “as if they are different from all other people or first class citizens while others are of no consequence”.
He said the number of lives lost to the act of brigandage being perpetrated by the Fulani herdsmen in the state and the country in general cannot be quantified, not to mention acts of rape on helpless women on farmlands and farms destroyed.

The OPC coordinator added that this attack if not curtailed quickly may result in food shortages in the nearest future and that it may be sending a very wrong signed to the perpetrators, “that they are above the law”.
Olumo stated that government should not wait until things get out of hand, where people are forced to defend themselves before taken appropriate action.
He called on all traditional rulers in Nigeria in general and the state in particular to be extra vigilant in their area and fashion out measures to prevent further attacks and safeguard the lives of their people and their farmlands.
Also, he advised law enforcement agencies not to shirk their primary responsibility of protecting the citizenry and their properties, saying that, they should take pro-active actions to tackle the problem.
