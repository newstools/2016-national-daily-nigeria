CUSTOMS Area Controller, Apapa Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Comptroller Willy Egbudin has disclosed that the command revenue generation in the first quarter of 2016 declined by 21% from what it generated the same period last year.
While charging clearing agents, importers as well Customs officers to demonstrate high level of integrity and discipline in the cargo clearance process to improve on the command’s revenue generation, Egbudin said the command generated N61.7billion in the first quarter of this year as against N74.71billion collected in the corresponding period of 2015, representing 21% drop in revenue.
“Due to the general economy down turn, vessels don’t come as they use to come. Bulk cargoes are not coming because they have been denied access to foreign exchange.

Despite that, some consignments are still coming in so we need to look inward to make do with the little ones we have and fashion out a way of improving the revenue of the command.”
“Discipline and integrity will take us to a very high level of ensuring that we collect the adequate revenue that is expected of us. It is not only on the side of Customs but also among agents and importers and all stakeholders.
“We must ensure that we allow our integrity to be intact and do what is right in order for us to improve the revenue,” he said.
The Customs boss advised agents to always comply with trade regulations and make honest declaration so as to avoid unnecessary delay in clearing their consignments.
