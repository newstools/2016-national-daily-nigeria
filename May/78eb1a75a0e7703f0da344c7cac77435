DELIVERIES by the Volkswagen Group rose by 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2016. The Group handed over 2.5 million vehicles to customers from January to March 2016. At 967,100 units, Group deliveries in March almost matched the prior-year level.
“There was a solid growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions in the first quarter of 2016. The Group recorded its best start to the year in China since entering the market there”, Fred Kappler, Head of Group Sales at Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, said.
The Volkswagen Group delivered 447,600 new vehicles to customers in Europe in March, an increase of 2.7 percent compared with the previous year. While developments in Western Europe (+1.9 percent) were positive, there was a slight decrease on the home market of Germany (-2.5 percent). Momentum in France, Italy and Spain was particularly strong. The markets in Central and Eastern Europe also recorded strong growth in this period (+8.8 percent), but the continued tense situation in Russia (-3.3 percent) had an impact.
