Kolawole said that the Inspector General of Police also urged persons in possession of non-prohibited firearms to immediately obtain or renew their licenses before July, 2016 by following the process on the requisite web link of the Nigeria Police Central Information Centre (NCIS) on www.npf.gov.ng
