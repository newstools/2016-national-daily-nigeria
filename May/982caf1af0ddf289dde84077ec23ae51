Musiliu Obanikoro, the former minister of State for Defence, has described as untrue media reports that he is on the run to evade probe from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). According to Obanikoro, he is not a fugitive running away from justice, The Punch reports.
In a text message to The Punch, Obanikoro denied reports that he is on the run because of the on-going $2.1 arms probe by the EFCC. A former national security adviser, Sambo Dasuki, was charged in December 2015 in connection with the arms probe. Dasuki was accused of awarding phantom contracts to buy helicopters, fighter jets and ammunition, which he denied. But according to Obanikoro, the reports he had a role in the arm probe scandal, were in the realm of speculation.
A text by Obanikoro read, “To begin with, no allegation has been made against me officially that I know of. Therefore, I have no reason to run. I know for sure that all the accusations in the media are in the realm of speculation.

Obanikoro, recently bagged a degree in History from an American university. Shortly after former President Goodluck Jonathan lost his re-election bid last year, Obanikoro said he was going to pursue an academic course in the US, stressing that life was not all about politics. “That’s politics for you; you win some, you lose some. And there’s life after politics. I’m going to the US to pursue a degree,” he had said.
However, it is yet to be known if he is going to make a return to the country when he completes his degree. Obanikoro was accused of allegedly masterminding the rigging of the Ekiti state governorship elections alongside Governor Ayo Fayose in 2014.
The EFCC also accused Obanikoro’s sons, Babajide and Gbolahan of N4.8b fraud.
