The Jackson Family are putting plans in place to set up a music academy in Lagos.
Jermaine Jackson on April 29, 2016 laid out the plans to set up a Jackson Academy Performing Art School in Lagos to raise musical talents in Nigeria and Africa.
Jackson revealed the plan when he paid a courtesy visit to the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Steve Ayorinde at the state government secretariat in Ikeja, Lagos.
According to Jermaine, “There is a lot of great talents here and we want to use our 50 years of experience in being in the business to teach the arts. We want to construct the Jackson Academy Performing Art School here.”

“It will have a curriculum and also will teach music, directing, film, lightening, producing, dancing and so on. We want to get the talents here ready for the global market. I do believe that the drums and the beat started from here”.
Jermaine was in Nigeria to mark the Jackson Golden Jubilee in a stage performance when he said “We are bringing a team together of people who can produce a concert. It’s been 50 years for the Jacksons.”
The concert held on Saturday April 30, 2016.
