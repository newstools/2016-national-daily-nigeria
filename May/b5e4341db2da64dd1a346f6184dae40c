The General Secretary of Nigeria Football Federation, Dr. Mohamed Sanusi, Chief Operating Officer of the League Management Company, Mallam Salihu Abubakar and NFF’s Club Licensing Manager Nasiru Jibril are back in the country after being part of a two –day FIFA Club Licensing seminar in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

The seminar was attended by representatives of FIFA Member Associations and Clubs from East, West and North Africa, and held at the African Union headquarters in the Ethiopian capital. It was the latest in a series of such seminars as FIFA works to implement a global licensing system, in conjunction with the confederations, to professionalise clubs in all key areas, including technical, commercial and governance perspectives.

Officials from Nigeria were joined by those from host Ethiopia, Egypt, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Sudan at the seminar that was held in conjunction with CAF. Representatives of CAF, members of African national leagues, clubs and club football experts from Asia, Europe and the Americas were also in attendance, according to cafonline.com.

“This is an important initiative that is providing all participating members associations, as well as the clubs, leagues and players in attendance, with the basic tools required to implement club licensing,” said Nigeria’s Salihu Abubakar. “The Nigeria Professional Football League has been fortunate by being one of the first countries in the CAF region to implement the system, and we are already witnessing the development of the clubs both on and off the field. We want our leagues and clubs in Africa to be more professional and the club licensing syetem is the key development tool we need.”
