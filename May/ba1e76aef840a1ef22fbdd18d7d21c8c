While declaring the public hearing open, Yakubu Dogara, the Speaker, House of Representatives, expressed optimism that if the obsolete Act of the Nigeria Railway Corporation was repealed, Nigerians would enjoy cheaper means of transporting their goods.

He said Nigerians would also enjoy quality services and the incessant damage to roads by heavy duty trucks would be reduced.
