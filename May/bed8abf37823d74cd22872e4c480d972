A report has revealed how ​John Terry took a pay cut of £90,000-a-week  to sign his latest contract extension with the club.
According to the Daily Mail UK, Terry was earning £140,000 but he took a huge pay cut which now reduces his wages by £50,000. That translates to a loss of almost £5m a year for the former England man, who is said to have turned down lucrative moves to China to extend his stay at Stamford Bridge.
The new deal is said to have a number of performance and appearance based clauses in it, but Terry has been warned that incoming manager Antonio Conte does not see him as an automatic starter at centre-back. Gary Cahill and a fit-again Kurt Zouma are expected to be first choice centre-back pairing with Terry expected to aid their developments.
