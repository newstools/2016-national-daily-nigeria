Taylor Rosenthal can’t even legally drive but has already turned down a $30 million offer to buy his start-up RecMed, CNN Money reported on Tuesday.
The 14-year-old exhibited his start-up, a vending machine that serves first-aid kits rather than snacks, at TechCrunch Disrupt NY this week.
 “They told me that I was the youngest person to ever get accepted to the event,” said Rosenthal in an interview with CNN Money. “It felt awesome.”
Rosenthal’s idea started as a class project after he noticed a lack of first-aid supplies available for purchase at baseball tournaments.
To date, the start-up has raised $100,000. Rosenthal plans to start distributing the machines in the fall.
