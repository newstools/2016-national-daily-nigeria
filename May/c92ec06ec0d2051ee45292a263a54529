Tension has continued to mount in the Niger Delta as the federal government plans military onslaught on emerging militant groups in the region. More militant groups seem to be emerging in preparation for showdown with the Army in the region.
Accordingly, a new militant group, Red Egbesu Water Lions, has surfaced apparently to reinforce other groups in the Niger Delta.

The emergent Red Egbesu Water Lions, in a statement by its Creek Network Coordinator,
“General” Torunanawei Latei, said it was teaming up with the Niger Delta Avengers and Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB.

The group declared that it has issued the Federal Government a seven-day ultimatum to release Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader; Sambo Dasuki, former National Security Adviser (NSA); and direct EFCC to defreeze the bank accounts of ex-militant leader, Government Ekpemupol, alias Tompolo.

Threatening to shut down all oil exploration activities in the Niger Delta at the expiration of the ultimatum, the group also demanded unconditional immediate payment to victims of the Bonga Oil Spill and Chevron gas explosion in Koluama, Bayelsa State.

“It is extremely important to note that the engine room of the national interest is the
executive obedience to court orders, protection and preservation of citizens’ constitutional liberties. Justification of executive disobedience to court orders as a protection of national interest is abominable. This is a deliberate ploy to bend the law and suspend the 1999 Constitution. We ask, does President Muhammadu Buhari have any legal capacity to declare anyone as a criminal? Disobedience to court orders is an act of executive rascality in the country,” the group declared.

Suspected militants, had Tuesday night, blew up the Sagbama-Tuomo gas line, belonging to Nigerian Agip Oil Company, NAOC, at Egbembiri, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, Bayelsa State.
