The Cable informs that the Niger Delta militants have bombed a section of the Escravos gas trunkline behind salvation city, near Ogbe-Ijoh in Warri South West local government area of Delta state
One of the sources told reporters that the incident occurred in the early hours of May 20, Friday. He defined the attack as a “big blow” to gas production in Nigeria, disclosing that the facility belongs to phase two of the Escravos-Lagos gas pipeline owned by the Nigerian Gas Company Limited (NGC). Escravos Lagos pipeline was attacked in February, causing the shortage of 3,132 megawatts of electricity, and difficulties for operators of power generation plants. The militants are again blowing up the pipelines that criss-cross the mangrove swamps of Nigeria’s Niger River delta after years of relative piece.
These bombings reduced oil output to the lowest in almost three decades and increasing a rally in world crude prices. The government of President Buhari has directed his army to deal with the militants with a heavy hand. The new militant group; Niger Delta Avengers, that appeared recently, said they have nothing to do with older militants and unveiled the list of their demands.
