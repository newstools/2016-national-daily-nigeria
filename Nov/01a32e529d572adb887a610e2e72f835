An Igbo group based in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, ILOM Igbo Family Unit, has given an award to the detained leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu for his struggles in actualising the sovereign state of Biafra.
The award, Kpakpando 1 (Shinning Star) of Biafra coincided with the demand for the first time by Igbo leaders for Kanu’s release.
The award was received by Kanu’s father, Eze Israel Okwu Kanu at his Afara Ukwu home in Umuahia, Abia State.
The coordinator of the group, Nwosu Emmanuel said they honoured the IPOB leader because of his untiring efforts in liberating Biafra from what he called the shackles of Nigeria enslavement.
“We decided to give Nnamdi Kanu, the IPOB leader, the award because we see him as the true Biafra leader; he is the one that will take us to the Promisedland.”
Deputy coordinator of the group, Chukwunyere Chibuike said Kanu has sacrificed a lot for Biafra and deserved every recognition in Igboland.
Eze Kanu said with the award, his son’s spirit would be high even as he is still in detention.
Younger brother of the detained IPOB, Emmanuel, showered praises on members of the group, stating that their journey to Umuahia to see members of Kanu’s family was heartwarming.
He promised to inform the IPOB leader about the award as soon as possible.
