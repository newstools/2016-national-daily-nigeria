A former Speaker in Imo State House of Assembly, Mr. Nwoha Amaechi, on Friday blasted the Senate over the amendment of the Code of Conduct Bureau.
Amaechi described the amendment of the act as a forceful takeover of powers of the bureau for selfish reasons.
He said, “The action of the National Assembly can best be described as legislative recklessness.
“Such amendment and forceful takeover of powers to control an institution created by our constitution is contrary to the legislative forbearance practised in other climes.
“It is obvious that it is self-serving and targeted at the heart of the criminal prosecutions involving some members of the National Assembly.”
Amaechi called on Nigerians to resist the law, saying that it would undermine the rule of law by making the country’s institutions weaker.
He said that it was time Nigerians upheld the integrity and sanctity of the law by shaking off every element of suspicion to bend the law.
Amaechi said that there was no justification for the amendment, adding that it was time for such legislative rascality to be addressed.
The Senate amended the Code of Conduct Bureau Act, transferring the control of the bureau from the Presidency to the National Assembly.
