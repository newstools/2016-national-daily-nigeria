Over 1, 000 supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Oke-Agbe, local government headquarters of Akoko North West in Ondo State, defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Gabriel Talabi a chieftain of the PDP and Sunday Akindeji the secretary of AD in that council, led the defectors to the ruling party. They officially dumped their old parties at the campaign rally of the APC governorship candidate, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN at Oke-Agbe.
They were received by Akeredolu, the Director General of his Campaign, Victor Olambitan, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, Tunji Abayomi among others. Talabi lamented the neglect of the local government area by the outgoing PDP administration in terms of roads and other social amenities. He stressed that they have decided to join the progressive party and also believes that if Akeredolu emerges, Akoko will not be neglected.
Akeredolu and Olabimtan who spoke respectively at the rally promised to correct the mistakes of the past in the local government if APC wins the coming governorship election.
Just recently about 2000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Otukpo local government, Benue state, have dumped the party for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). At a defection ceremony held at Otukpo-Icho, which is also the country home of deputy governor Engr. Benson Abounu, the new APC members were received by the number two man in the state.
