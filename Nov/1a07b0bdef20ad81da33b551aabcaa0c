Ex-Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service Abdullahi Dikko under EFCC’s investigation has returned N1.4 billion of the N40 billion missing when he headed the service between 2009 and 2015.
According to the Punch, a reliable source within the EFCC confirmed that the suspect has been returning money to the government.
“So far, Dikko has returned over N1bn. He returned N1bn and then N4m. He is still expected to return more money, ” the source told the newspaper.
Apart from the amount returned, a property estimated at N2 billion Dikko owned at Jabi, Abuja, was seized early this year by the agency.
According to the source, Dikko served for about 30 years in the NCS, and he has to explain where he got the money to buy a mansion of N2bn.
The ex-Customs CG is also believed to own properties in Dubai and in Katsina, his home state.
Although he was arrested in June, after he bolted out of the country for a while, Dikko has been released because of his poor health.
