Abdullahi Ganduje, Governor of Kano State, has advised members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) in Kano, popularly known as Shi’ites, to recognise the authority of security officials by seeking their permission before they hold any gathering.
Ganduje said this in an interview with journalists on the sideline of the third edition of the Nigeria Entrepreneurs Award in Abuja.
The governor said members of the sect could not keep breaking the law and tampering with the rights of other citizens.
“As far as they continue breaking the law, the police have to come in. They cannot use they-have-the-freedom-to-do-whatever-they-want because they are crossing other people’s human rights.
“As far as we are concerned, they have to recognise the authority; they have to get permission.
“If they do not get permission, then the police will not allow them to continue the procession that they do.”
Some people were killed during a clash between members of the sect and the police on Monday. While the group claimed that it lost close to 100 members, the police said eight people, including an officer, died in the incident.
The police said security operatives, including anti-robbery squad units, intervened when Shi’ites began attacking motorists and passersby during its annual Araben trek.
In October, Kano police banned IMN from conducting street processions ahead of the annual Ashura celebration.
