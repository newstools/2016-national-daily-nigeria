There are indications that due to the militancy in the Niger Delta region that has reduced Nigeria’s oil production, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) unveiled plans to purchase oil from Niger Republic to Kaduna refinery.
A report revealed that Mr. Maikanti Baru who is the group managing director of NNPC said this after a bilateral discussion with the minister of energy and oil of the Republic of Niger, Hon. Foumakoye Gado, in Abuja.
Baru said that the NNPC would partner with Niger in the area of sharing geological data to further boost the ongoing exploratory activities in the Chad Basin and Benue Trough. “There will be steering committee comprising some
Ministers and a technical committee which will involve the NNPC and the Nigerien Ministry of Energy and Oil and their operators.” the Nigerien Energy Minister, Hon. Gado said his visit was to discuss issues of interest especially in the area of the oil sector with the NNPC.
He said the procurement of crude oil for Kaduna refinery and its practicability was being worked out. “One of the aims of this visit is to share geological information for us to draw the best profit out of the exploratory efforts.” Meanwhile, just a day after President Muhammadu Buhari’s meeting with Niger Delta leaders where he was presented with a 16-point demand, oil-producing communities, under the aegis of Host Communities of Nigeria, Producing Oil and Gas (HOSTCOM) have submitted 5 new additional demands.
