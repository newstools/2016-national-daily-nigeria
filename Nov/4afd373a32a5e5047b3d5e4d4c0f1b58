The Rivers State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has alleged that the State Governor, Nyesom Wike held a secret meeting with one of the Supreme Court Justices recently arrested by security agencies with the aim of perverting justice in his governorship election case.
Recall that some judges were recently arrested by security agencies over alleged corruption across the country.
Chairman of the River State APC, David Ikyanya in a statement claimed that the meeting between Wike and the judge, whose name was not mentioned was held in Owerri, Imo State.
The statement reads in part, “Again, we stand by our earlier statement on the ignominious roles of the governors of Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Delta States, and the Senate Minority leader in the pervasion of the course of justice at the apex court and the subsequent failed attempt to pin the Justices’ travails on Amaechi. In the days ahead, more details will continue to come out.
“For instance, it is already in the open that Governor Nyesom Wike held a secret meeting in a hotel in Owerri, Imo State with one of the Supreme Court Justices that was arrested by the Directorate of State Services (DSS).
“The agenda of that meeting was for the apex court Justice to assist Wike to get a favourable judgment and pervert the course of justice in the Rivers State governorship election matter that was then about going to the apex court.”
