In his acceptance speech in New York City Trump said he was sorry for keeping his supporters waiting. Emphasizing politics is complicated business.
In his words “I just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She fought hard. Hillary is owed a major debt gratitude for her service to the country. It is time to come together as one United people. I will be President for all Americans. I reach out to all.
“Ours was a movement not a campaign. We are set to build a great America. We are going to rebuild America infrastructure. We will become second to none. We will take care of our veterans. We will harness the creative talent of our people. We will get along with other nations. Nothing is beyond our reach. We will dream big, bold and daring. We will be friends to people of other nations”.
