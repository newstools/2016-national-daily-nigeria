Godswill Akpabio, Senate Minority Leader, has described Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state, as Nigeria’s shinning light of infrastructural development.
According to Simeon Nwakaudu, Special Assistant to the Rivers state governor on electronic media, said Akpabio made the commendation during a courtesy visit to Wike in Port Harcourt, Rivers state capital.
The senate minority leader reportedly commended the governor for transforming the state in the last 17 months.
Akpabio, a former governor of Akwa Ibom, noted that through careful planning and the right application of resources, Wike had ensured even development across the state despite the economic downturn.
He also commended the governor for his amnesty programme that has improved peace in the state, noting that the restoration of peace in the state had led to the entrenchment of development process.
“I am here to commend Governor Wike for his giant development strides across the state; he is a shining light of infrastructural development,” he reportedly said.
“I urge him to continue to develop Rivers state; this is a governor that has defied the economic downturn to improve the living condition of his people; we are proud of him.”
