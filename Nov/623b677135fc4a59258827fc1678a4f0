Managers of the National Youth Service Corps have been urged to institutionalize teamwork as a strategy for the achievement of the scheme’s mandate.

This was one of the key points of a lecture on the theme: “Re-invigorating the NYSC Orientation Course to Achieve the Desired Objectives of the Scheme” delivered by a Director of the National Productivity Centre, Mrs. Aor Adebimpe at the 2016 Batch ‘B’ Pre-Orientation Workshop in Calabar.

Adebimpe said the place of the NYSC is strategic at this period of Nigeria’s history, noting also that Orientation course plays fundamental role in achieving its objectives.

She said every individual involved in the operations of the Scheme had very important roles to play; hence the need for a collective resolve to make it stronger.

The guest lecturer also stressed that the actions and decisions of every staff must align with the strategic objectives of the scheme.

Adebimpe said even the most junior member of staff should be equipped with the right knowledge as, according to her, individual behaviours can be so strong that they can either help hinder the organization’s ultimate goals.

“The key to organizational success is identifying critical information required to make correct decisions and ensuring that the information is in the decision makers’ hands if and when they need it,” she said.

The lecturer called for clear definition of required decisions and roles of individuals in decision-making in order to ensure good performance.
