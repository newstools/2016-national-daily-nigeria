Ericsson Nigeria, telecommunications services provider has served its Nigerian workers sack notice which will take effect by the end of this November.
Investigation gathered shows that the affected workers are working in the Network Operating Centre (NOC) of the company and they are required to do a knowledge transfer to the Indians that will take over their jobs.
Investigations also revealed that Ericsson carried out similar exercise of sacking Nigerian workers in July this year when some part of MTN managed services handled by Ericsson was moved to India.
Now the Indians want to handle more of the services precipitating the recent sack notice to additional workers.
It was learnt that Ericsson Nigeria has sacked more workers in Nigeria than other African countries not because the jobs are not there but because it is easier to get away with such practice in Nigeria and the jobs are now remotely done from India which means money generated in Nigeria are used to enrich India.
Confirming the development the managing director, Ericsson Nigeria, Johan Jemdahl said that, “To maintain a leading position, Ericsson is continuously evolving and transforming the way we deliver services, both locally and globally, for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we constantly review and adjust cost levels as market growth and business needs are changing over time from a global perspective.
“Transformation is about uncovering opportunities to further leverage global skills and scale to increase efficiencies and reduce cost across the business. This is not something that is happening only here, it is something we are doing on a global, regional and local level in our services business. It is part of being a services company. If and when we have information about any measures to take, we will as always inform affected employees first.”
