The senate has directed five of its standing committees to commence investigation into the concessioning of rail lines to General Electric (GE), a US infrastructure company, by the ministry of transportation.
The committees are privatisation, land transport, anti-corruption and financial crimes,  special duties, trade and investment and judiciary.
Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, was accused of not following due process in concessioning the key infrastructure to GE.
The process was also alleged to have not been open to competitive bidding,  while necessary legal procedures were allegedly bypassed.
In a motion on Tuesday, Bassey Akpan, a senator from Akwa Ibom north-east, alleged that Amaechi breached the Public Enterprises Privatisation & Commercialisation Act 1999 by unilaterally engaging GE without recourse to the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE).
Subsequently, the upper legislative chamber mandated its committees to investigate the allegation.
