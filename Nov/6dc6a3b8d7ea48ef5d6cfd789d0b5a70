Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), on Sunday said Gov. Adams Oshiomhole of Edo has changed the narrative of the state.
Oyegun said this at the sent-off party organised by the South South zone of the APC in honour of Oshiomhole who exit as governor on Nov.12, following completion of his two terms of eight-year tenure.
Oyegun said before Oshiomhole assumed office as governor, the state was considered as a civil service state and as such not viable.
He stressed that through desire to effect positive change in the state, Oshiomhole embarked upon ambitious infrastructural transformation of the state through massive construction of roads, schools, hospital and others.
He said through these projects, Oshiomhole had placed the state on a new pedestal.
According to him, Oshiomhole has proved that Edo is the heart beat of the nation.
“Oshiomhole has done well. We are proud of him.
“People of South South see him as a beacon of hope for that we need to be proud of.
“He (Oshiomhole) has laid a solid foundation that Obaseki, the in-coming government needs to build on. It is my prayer that he and his deputy do better than he (Oshiomhole) has done. If that happens, Edo will be better for it,” said Odigie-Oyegun.
Similarly, the National Vice Chairman, South South, APC, Mr Hilliard Eta, said unlike some governors, Oshiomhole did not turn himself into an “emperor” while in office.
Describing Oshiomhole’s infrastructural development as unparallel, Eta said Oshiomhole was able to achieve that through prudent management of the state resources.
“Oshiomhole has changed the story of Edo. He has brought dynamism into the polity of the state.
“He should be commended because he has done well. For his achievement, I am recommending him for higher responsibility,” Eta said.
