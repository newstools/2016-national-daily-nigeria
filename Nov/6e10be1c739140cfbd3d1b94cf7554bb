The spokesperson to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Fanwo Kingsley, has denied reports that his principal had died.


Rumours were rife Sunday that Bello passed away in a foreign country.
Kingsley said in a statement Monday that the governor was “hale and hearty”.

“I want to state clearly here for the avoidance of doubt that the rumour lacks any iota of truth. It is a reflection of the depth the enemies of Kogi State have gone in their desperate angst against fate

“To put the record straight, the Governor is hale and hearty, healthy and unwavering in his vigour to make Kogi State the Confluence of Excellence,” he said.
Mr. Kingsley said Mr. Bello was only enjoying a two-week break and will return on November 12.

He urged the citizens of Kogi state to “discountenance the rumour”.

He also thanked the people for their “ love and sense of solidarity”.
