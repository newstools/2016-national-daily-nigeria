ACTIVITIES at the bonds segment of the Nigerian capital market recorded a boost on the heels of weakened investors’ appetite for the equities market.
The weekly report of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the week ended November 4, 2016 revealed.
A bond is a debt investment in which an investor loans money to an entity (typically corporate or governmental) which borrows the funds for a defined period of time at a variable or fixed interest rate.
Specifically, the Federal Government (FG) bonds recorded a whopping 217.56 per cent increase in volume traded in the week under review, from a total of 4100 units of FG bonds valued at N4287 million transacted in 3 deals to a total 13,020 units of FG bonds valued at N12, 953 in 14 deals, where the value traded recorded a significant 202.15 per cent growth.
