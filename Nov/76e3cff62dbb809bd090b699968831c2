The Federal Road Safety Commission has advised motorists plying the Lagos-Ibadan expressway to seek alternative routes due to ongoing repairs on the route.
Mr Bisi Kazeem, its Head of Media and Strategy, gave the advice in an interview with the National Daily on Friday.
“In view of this, motorists could take these alternative routes: motorists from Benin could link Lagos through Ijebuode -Epe -Lekki or Ijebuode -Ikorodu.
“Those from Ibadan -Lagos could use Odo- Ona-Apata-Omi Adio-Abeokuta -Itori -Ifo-Sango Ota, Sagamu -Papa Lanto- Ifo- Sango Ota and Sagamu -Ofada- Mowe.
“Traffic from Lagos -Benin could use Epe or Ikorodu axis to link Ijebu- Ode. Traffic from Lagos -Ibadan axis could use Sango Ota- Ifo- Abeokuta –Ibadan,’’ he said.
Kazeem said that ambulances, motorcycles, patrol vehicles and tow trucks had been adequately deployed with enough personnel to control traffic
