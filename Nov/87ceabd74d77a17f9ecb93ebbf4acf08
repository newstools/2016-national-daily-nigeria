“We will continue to arrest them and hand them over to the appropriate authorities,’’ he said.
On his most challenging moment as the GOC, Gen Edet who is now the Corps Commander, Infantry Corps in Jaji said it was during the abduction of three of his intelligence operatives by militants in Ijedodo in Ijagemo Area of Lagos.
“I had to work round-the-clock to secure their release,’’ he said.
On pipeline vandals at Arepo area of Ikorodu, the outgone GOC said the Army worked “collaboratively and cooperatively with other security agencies to rout the vandals from the area.”
In his remark, the new GOC, Maj Gen. Oyefolu, said he would key into the successes of his predecessor to move the Division forward.
The handing over witnessed the decoration of the new GOC with the division’s insignia – badge and shoulder flash, the quarter guard ceremony and the signing of handover notes.
