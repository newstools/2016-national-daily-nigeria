Senator Ben Murray Bruce, has said that air disaster looms in the country as Nigerian airlines are allegedly not servicing their aircraft because they cannot get foreign exchange.
The lawmaker representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District, lamented that airline operators cannot get forex to buy aircraft parts, thus flying planes that ‘could drop’.
The media mogul and social media savvy lawmaker in a series of tweets with the hashtag #AccidentWaitingToHappen, narrated the challenges faced by the aviation industry and warned that disasters loom if urgent actions are not taken to address the challenges.
The tweets read: “Just spoke with the head of an airline and Nigerian airlines are not servicing planes because they can’t get forex.
“Pilgrims get forex at special rates while airlines can’t get it to buy parts and are flying planes that could drop. Right now in Nigeria, even aviation fuel isn’t available. Airlines are forced to cut corners and put lives at risk.”
“Regulators license airlines with one plane. The plane is overworked without access to necessary service and parts. “Airlines are forced to source for forex on the parallel market. They are forced to cut corners and risk lives.
He said in all airports across the country, there are delays because of lack of aviation fuel, spare parts for services and a weak regulator.
“We must show concern for those who don’t have access to presidential jets and private jets. Human lives are at risk.”
