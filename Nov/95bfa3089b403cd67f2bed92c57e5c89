The Kano State Hisbah Board (Sharia Police) has said it had commenced the prosecution of 11 women for allegedly engaging in social vices.
Salisu Umar, the Commander, Special Services of the board, told reporters in Kano yesterday that the suspects were apprehended around the Sabongari area in the metropolis.
He said they were arrested during a special patrol conducted by the Fagge local government office of the Board.
Mr. Umar said the suspects were found drinking alcohol, smoking cannabis and romancing with men other than their husbands or close relations, which is contrary to the Sharia legal system.
He said the state had been practicing the Islamic legal code that prohibits such illicit attitudes, stressing that the board would intensify its efforts to patrol identified flash points.
“The suspects are females between the ages of 21 and 24 and were apprehended around midnight at beer parlours in Faringida and Abedie Road in Sabongari,’’ Umar said.
“We have brought them before a competent Sharia court for prosecution,” he said.
Mr. Umar explained that the suspects were screened and taken to court and they were now awaiting trial at the Central Prisons, Kano, as their case was adjourned till November 14th, 2016.
He said the board would not condone any act of immorality, stressing that it would arrest and prosecute whoever engages in such vices.
Mr. Umar noted that four out of the suspects were divorcees with kids, while one of them was carrying a three-month-old pregnancy.
No details were provided by the News Agency of Nigeria as to whether men in the beer parlour or with whom the women romanced were also arrested.
