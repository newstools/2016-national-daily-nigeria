The Edo House of Assembly on Wednesday approved the construction of houses for former governors and their deputies which should not be more than N200m and N100m, respectively, in any location of their choice.
The approval was sequel to the consideration of a bill for a law to amend the existing legislation on the Pension Rights of Governors and their Deputies in the state.
Moving the motion for the consideration of the bill, the Majority Leader, Foly Ogedengbe, moved that House rules 20, 27, 42, 43, 44 and 45 be suspended, to enable the assembly to consider the bill.
The motion was seconded by the Deputy Speaker, Elizabeth Ativie (APC -Uhunwode).
Considering the bill as a committee of the whole, the lawmakers amended the law to read that a governor and his deputy shall be entitled to a house each, at any location of their choice.
The new law, however, provides that the houses shall not be more than N200m and N100m, respectively.
