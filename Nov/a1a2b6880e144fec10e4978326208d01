The leader of a militant group, Niger Delta Peoples Democratic Front, NDPDF, Gen. Playboy has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to put a stop to military invasion on the residence of former militant leader, Chief Government Ekpemupolo alias Tompolo or oil companies in the region will be chased out.
He gave the warning following the Saturday’s invasion of Tompolo residence by operatives of the Joint Task Force, code named Operation Delta Safe.
In a statement he personally signed, Playboy warned that should military operatives invade Tompolo’s residence again, they would attack three central mosques in the region.
The terse statement reads, “If it is true that his (Tompolo) house was raided, then President Buhari must stop it. If he does not stop, what we will do is to chase away oil companies in our land. We cannot be feeding Nigeria and at the same time be humiliated by Nigeria.”
This warning is coming just few days after Adaka Boro Avengers, ABA, issued a-seven-day ultimatum to the Federal Government and the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, to evacuate oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region.
