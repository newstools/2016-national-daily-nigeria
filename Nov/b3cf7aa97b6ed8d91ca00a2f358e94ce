The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa has raised the alarm over some fake Facebook accounts opened in her name by some fraudsters.
Dabiri-Erewa, in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, said some fraudsters have created phony accounts in her name on Facebook to defraud unsuspecting members of the public.
The statement signed by her Special Assistant on Media, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, warned members of the public to be wary of such accounts stressing that Mrs. Dabiri-Erewa had no “FACEBOOK’’ accounts.
She said that the scammers opened 11 different face book accounts using them to send all manners of scam letters to dupe unsuspecting Nigerians.
The presidential aide advised members of the public to disregard any such Facebook page purportedly belonging `Abike Dabiri-Erewa` as she does not operate any Facebook account.
The SSA said she was always available and members of the public could reach her on: ssa@diaspora.gov.ng on issues pertaining to her office.
While noting that she had reported the issue several times to Facebook, she urged online platform to look into such easy methods of cloning peoples’ identity.
“The issue is already being handled by the security agencies to track down those behind creation of these fake accounts,” she said.
