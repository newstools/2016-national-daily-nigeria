The Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Mr. Tunde Fowler, said that the organisation received more than 700,000 applications from the recent job advertisement it placed in some national newspapers.
Fowler, who made this known on Wednesday in Abuja when he appeared before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Public Petition, said only 500 of the applicants would be employed.
FIRS boss’ appearance at the lower chamber followed a petition from some applicants, who claimed to have been excluded from the employment processes.
Fowler said that out of the 700,000 applicants more than 2,000 had first class degrees in various disciplines and were qualified to be engaged by the FIRS.
He added that the exercise was designed to increase manpower for tax revenue collection and expand the country’s revenue base.
He assured the lawmakers that the organisation would ensure fairness and due process in the recruitment process.
“We have secured waiver and endorsement from the Federal Character Commission in order to ensure that the right thing is done.’’
In his remarks, the Chairman of the House committee, Mr. Nkem Abonta, directed Fowler to submit to the committee the service’s nominal roll to assist it in arriving at a decision.
