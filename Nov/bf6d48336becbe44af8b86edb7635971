The disposed former Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki, has died in an Abuja hospital on Monday night at the age of 92.
He was the 18th Sultan of Sokoto until he was disposed in a questionable circumstance by the late General Sani Abacha in 1996 and replaced with Alhaji Mohammadu Maccido.
The late Dasuki, who is the father of the embattled Col Sambo Dasuki, who is enmeshed in siphoning moneys met to procure arms for the military, was said to have held the traditional title of Baraden Sokoto.
Dasuki was born in Dogon Daji, Sokoto. He was the son of Haliru Ibn Barau who held the title of Sarkin Yamma and who was the district head of Dogon Daji.
He was said to have started Quaranic education in 1928. In 1931, he attended Dogondaji Elementary School before proceeding to Sokoto Middle School in 1935. He finished his secondary education at Barewa College on a sponsorship from Sokoto Native Authority.
After finishing high school in 1943, he worked as a clerk in the treasury office of the Sokoto Native Authority as it was the tradition in Northern Nigeria for grant recipients to work for their sponsors, their respective Native Authorities.
However, in 1945, he took up appointment with Gaskiya Corporation, a publishing house that published the Hausa daily, Gaskiya Ta Fi Kwabo .
In 1953, heeding the call by Ahmadu Bello for Northern Nigeria citizens to take up appointment in the regional civil service , he joined the service as an executive officer.
