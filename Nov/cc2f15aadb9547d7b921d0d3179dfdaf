Abdulmumin Jibrin, the federal lawmaker (House of Reps) suspended for 180 legislative days over his alleged abuse of privileges in levelling corruption allegations against Speaker Yakubu Dogara and 11 others, is now living in exile.
He said on Monday, a day after receiving a whistleblowing award in London, that those he accused of padding N40 billion into the 2016 budget are planning to assassinate him.
So he decided to stay out the suspension in the UK where he plans to continue the fight, for security reasons—and for the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari has been quiet for too long over the matter, which Jibrin sought his intervention.
There are media reports, however, the EFCC has swung into the investigation by requesting for the asset declaration details of the 12 lawmakers from the Code of Conduct Bureau.
The lawmaker said he had recently discovered that his security was no longer guaranteed and, as such, it would be foolhardy if he remained in the country.
Jibrin said this when he appeared on a Ben Television program in London Monday.
He said a five-man cabal Dogara heads was plotting to either kidnap him or assassinate him or members of his family.
Others he fingered in the plot are Deputy Speaker, Yusuf Lasun; Minority Leader, Leo Ogor; House Whip Alhassan Ado-Doguwa and a member, Herma Hembe.
The African Voice Newspaper said Jibrin deserved the award for his whistleblowing activities.
There are no official responses yet from the five.
On Buhari’s apathy, Jibrin said, “The situation currently at hand is different from the initial stage of the crisis.”
“The silence of the presidency is no longer sending the right message to Nigerians and the international community.”
