National Daily has reliably learned that a Federal High Court in Abuja has granted former aviation minister Femi Fani-Kayode N50 million bail and a surety in like some.
Fani-Kayode’s bail application was approved after he was arraigned today, Thursday, November 10. Fani-Kayode was arrested by the Economic and finacial Crimes Commission (EFCC) weeks ago.
Fani-Kayode, a former Director of Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, was re-arrested by EFCC operatives while emerging from a Federal High Court room in Lagos.
He is standing trial in the Lagos court alongside a former Minister of Finance, Nenandi Usman, one Danjuma Yusuf and a company, Joint Trust Dimension Nigeria Ltd.
The trio is facing a 17-count charge of unlawful retention, unlawful use and unlawful payment of money to the tune of about N4.9 billion, a charge they denied.
Reports say that the Prosecutor, Mr Rotimi Oyedepo, had concluded the witness’ evidence for the day, and the case adjourned till Nov. 14 and Nov. 15 for continuation of hearing.
Meanwhile, the PDP has warned that Fani-Kayode must not die in EFCC custody.
