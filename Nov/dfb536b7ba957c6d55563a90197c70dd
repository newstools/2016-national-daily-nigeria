A 49- year- old football coach, Frank Dar­lington Anyanwu, has narrated how he had seri­ally raped teenage footballers who are under his tutelage. Anyanwu who is the Ex­ecutive Manager, Soccer Warrior Academy, in Lagos, disclosed that he could not explain the reason for his attraction to innocent young children.
The coach who was pa­raded by the police, said: “I tried to stop this evil habit in July last year but could not as the lust kept coming on each time I want to drop it.” The coach who is an indi­gene of Imo State, revealed that he normally lures the innocent children to a quiet place before having anal sex with them.
According to him, the children in his academy are drawn from Primary to Ju­nior Secondary Schools and that he used to charge them N3000 per person in order to tutor them on how to play football.
He appealed to the police to forgive him as he has de­cided to stop the evil act and that he has brought back his to Lagos from the village.
“I beg the police to forgive me because I have decided to stop such satanic act because I have brought back my wife to stay with me. I sent her home because of poor finan­cial status, National Daily reports.
“I have been doing this evil for some years now. I have no attraction for doing that but it appears I am cursed,” he la­mented.
He regretted that one of the boys he had sex with told his parents about the inci­dent. “One day I went to the home of one of my victims to inquire why he was not forth coming but the mother alerted the police for my ar­rest,” he said.
Speaking on the issue, the Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Mr Fatai Owoseni, said the coach allegedly had intercourse with pupils he was coaching and that he was arrested through credible intelligence.
