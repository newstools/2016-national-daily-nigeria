A group, Movement for Democratic Dividends in Ondo State has accused justices of the Appeal court of laying the foundation for chaos in the state through what it described as “subversion of democracy” in the state.
“The refusal of the Justices of the Court of Appeal sitting on the Ondo Election Appeal is another dangerous step towards chaos in Ondo State and subversion of democracy in Nigeria.”
The group in a statement in Akure on Tuesday said “underhand tactics, blackmail and outright subterfuge as being employed by the Jimoh Ibrahim group ostensibly at the prodding of prominent APC goons cannot be stoke disquiet, anger and doubts. And when doubts are accentuated by feelings of injustice, lawlessness is the possible outcome.”
Adesoji Akinlamilo the group’s President, in the statement said: “the legal rigmarole and blackmail now being witnessed are only new steps by Jimoh Ibrahim and those urging him on within the APC to set the state on fire and make it ungovernable for the incumbent as he had long vowed to do.”
The group which said a new foundation for chaos is being laid through the Ondo debacle called on well-meaning Nigerians to prevail on President Buhari to note the historical realities of Nigeria and save Ondo State and by implication, Nigeria from the chaos that could result when all hope are lost in the judiciary.
