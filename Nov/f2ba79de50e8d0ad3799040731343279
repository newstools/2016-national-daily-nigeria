The factional candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, on Friday maintained that no amount of opposition will stop him from becoming the governor of the state. Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had recently replaced Jegede’s name with businessman, Jimoh Ibrahim as PDP governorship candidate in the state’s November 26 election, National Daily reports.
The factional PDP governorship candidate in a statement stressed that there was no going back on his pursuit because he has the interest of his people at heart. Jegede said,“I remain indebted to the wonderful people of Ondo state who have always remained steadfast with us knowing full well that this is one project that will succeed no matter the volume of opposition from any quarters.
“I again reiterate that I am absolutely committed to the rule of law, I have submitted my grievances to the courts and despite the contrivance and manipulation by those who are opposed to democracy, we have been vindicated at the first step and God willing we will continue to trudge on, National Daily reports.  “There is no looking back; we are here because we have the interest of the people at heart.”
