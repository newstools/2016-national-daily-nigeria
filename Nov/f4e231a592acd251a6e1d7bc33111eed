Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate, is asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), how it reviewed 650,000 e-mails in a day.
After FBI’s investigation cleared Hillary Clinton, Trump said the investigation was rigged as it was impossible to investigate 650,000 new emails in the pace of one day.
Trump expressed his displeasure over Clinton’s acquittal at a rally in Detroit suburb on Sunday.
“Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the president in the United states. The investigations and the crimes will go on for a long time the ranking files special ages at the FBI won’t let her get with her terrible crime including the deletion of 33,000 emails.
“Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system, I have been saying it for a long time. You can’t review 650,000 new emails in a day, Hillary Clinton is guilty, she knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it and now it is left to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8th”.
