The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ondo state has described Ekiti state governor, Ayodele Fayose’s call for violence should the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) loss the forthcoming Governorship election in Ondo State as unfortunate and a barbaric conduct.
The Party emphasised that the statement was unbecoming of a Governor and a supposed Chief Security Officer (CS0) of Ekiti State.
Fayose was quoted to have said during the PDP rally held in Akure that there would  be a repeat of 1983 violence in  Ondo state if PDP loss the forthcoming Governorship election in the state.
A statement issued by the APC’s spokesman in Ondo Central, where the rally took place, Charles Titiloye, noted that the statement had exposed the evil plot of PDP and its candidate Eyitayo Jegede who all the while have been promoting a political ethnic agenda tagged “Akure Agenda”.
APC noted that Fayose and Jegede are now frustrated that the multi ethnic and peaceful Akure people have refused to be deceived into a third term agenda of Mimiko under the guise of “Akure Agenda”.
It urged the PDP to focus its attention on its intra-party crisis of choice of candidate and not drag Ondo state into any form of electoral crisis.
The party noted that the party was on firm ground in Akure and its environs as the party presently occupies the senatorial, House of Representatives and state House of Assembly seats.
It urged Fayose to face his war against cattle farmers and normads in Ekiti and continue to arrest cows, saying“ We are not cows in Ondo state and nobody can push us into a violent fight and barbaric criminal killings.
The APC advised the governor to commence the 1983 electoral violence in his domain in Ekiti.
It urged the citizenry to remain calm and continue to live peacefully among one another.
