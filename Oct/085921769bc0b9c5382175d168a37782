Suspended Hon. Abdulmumin Jibrinn has filed a fresh suit against the leadership of the House, urging the court to declare his suspension as violation of his fundamental human rightsâ€”with N1 billion in damages.
He filed the fresh suit at the Federal High Abuja on Friday shortly after he withdrew the one of August 9 before the House suspended him.
The House ex-appropriation committee chair has been alleging Speaker Yakubu Dogara, his Deputy Yussuf Lasun; Chief Whip Ado Doguwa; Minority Leader Leo Ogor; and nine other members, accusing them of padding the 2016 budget.
He is now asking the court to declare that the resolution passed by the House of Representatives suspending him was in breach of Section 68 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.
He wants the court to also restrain the House of Representatives from preventing him from participating in the committees of the House or accessing the legislative chambers to perform his legislative duties.
Justice John Tsoho has fixed November 22 for hearing of the suit.
Tosho struck out the first suit filed by Mr. Jibrin, challenging his suspension from the House after his counsel Chukuma Nwachukwu asked for discontinuance.
