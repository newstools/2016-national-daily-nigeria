There are indications that Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former vice president Atiku Abubakar, may be considering plans to float a new party ahead of the 2019 general elections.
According to a report, an alliance between both political heavyweights looks imminent going by their recent displeasure with the presidency. A source says both Tinubu and Atiku are not happy with the presidency but do not want to come out openly on it.Â  It was widely reported recently of Northern plot to ease out Tinubu out of APC. The rift was so deep that Buhari was under pressure to set EFCC and DSS against him. However, there is another report of reconciliation between them.
