The police in Nassarawa are trying to unravel why a young man murdered his pregnant girlfriend in the state.
Police says the boy from Angwan Ninzo, Keffi, was arrested after he murdered his girlfriend who was pregnant.
It was learnt that the boy pushed her into the river where she was drowned.
Although the name of the suspects was not disclosed, the State Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq-Bello
assured the public that police in the state would not relent on their assault against criminals.
He, however, appealed to the public to work with the police to tackle crime in the state “so that law abiding citizens can sleep with their two eyes closed.”
