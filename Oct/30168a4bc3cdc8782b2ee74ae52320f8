Three serving ministers have come under severe attacks by members of secessionist groups, the Movement for the Actialisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and the Biafra Independent Movement (BIM) for allegedly working against the Biafra agitation.
They include immediate past governor of Rivers State and Minister of Transport, Rotimi Ameachi, his counterparts in the ministries of Labour and Productivity, Christ Ngige and Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu.
The groups said the trio it described as “self-styled Igbo-born power brokers fortunate to be at the corridors of power for selfish interests’  were clogs in the wheel of progress of Biafran Republic.
Leader of the group in Delta North Zone, Chinedu Amaefieobu, supported by the zonal commander of security, Ignatus Agili-Ajama, who spoke in Asaba, rallied support for Ralph Uwazuruike ahead of the remembrance of the late Odimegwu Ojukwu.
Amaefieobu said the aspirations of Ojukwu, the Biafran warlord in the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-1970, would be realised through Uwazuruike’s doggedness.
He said since the death of Ojukwu, Uwazuruike has kept faith with the tenets of the struggle for the actualisation of Biafra by keeping the struggle alive. He called on the international community to come to the aid of the agitators.
“We are calling on the United Nations (UN), France, Isreal, China, Russia and world leaders, to come to our aid, and force Nigerian security to stop killing our people in the name of one Nigeria because we are not in arms struggle with them.
“Since our representatives have failed us, we call on the entire Igboland to rally support for Ojukwu’s successor, Raph Uwazuruike – the Okemwan (true son of his father), instead of Amaechi, Onu and Ngige who not serving the Igboland, but the Nigeria government. They have forgotten the son of whom they are. ” he said.
