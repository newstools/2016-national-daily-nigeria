The Defence Headquarters has reemphasized that it would continue to abide with the ongoing negotiation effort of the Federal Government with militants in order to have peaceful settlement of the Niger Delta problem.
It however warned that during the peaceful negotiations, the military authority would not take kindly with any individual or group taking military’s good gesture of adherence to ceasefire and peaceful disposition to the impasse for granted.
It further stated that they would respond proportionately to any armed attacks against its location in a decisive but professional manner in line with its constitutional mandate of defending innocent citizens as well as national critical infrastructure.

The Defence Headquarters on Tuesday in a statement in Abuja signed by the spokesperson, Brig Gen Rabe Abubakar, explained that “It was also instructive to state that the Armed Forces have the capacity to defend itself just as it did recently when a group of misguided elements under the militancy guise attacked its location at Efut Esighi waterfront in Bakassi Local Government Area of Cross River State where they paid dearly for their evil act.
“The Armed Forces, therefore, warns various belligerent groups in either the Niger Delta or any other part of the nation to desist from any act capable of jeopardising peace and security of our country or they will regret the consequences of their evil action.
Gen Abubakar emphasised that the Armed Forces of Nigeria would continue to partner with peace-minded groups and stakeholders to bring lasting peace in any security threatened areas or locations in the country.
