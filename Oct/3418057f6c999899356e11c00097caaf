Embattled Kannywood actress, Rahama Sadau, has apologised to her fans and Nigerians over her role in a romantic music video.

For featuring in ClassiQ’s new single “I love You,” Rahama was expelled by the regulators of the Kannywood film industry, MOPPAN, recently.

In a letter she posted on her Instagram page on Tuesday, Rahama said she could not have played her role in the music video to hurt anyone.

“To those who I have offended in any way, shape or form and who I have caused any anxiety by featuring in the said music video, I sincerely apologize,” she wrote.

“I may have fallen short of some people’s expectations but it was never my intention.

“I make no excuses for my actions and I take full responsibility,” Rahama said.

The Kannywood star actress also thanked her fans for standing by her. She also appreciated the advice she received. “I implore us all to be more tolerant and forgiving towards one another,” Rahama said.

“She has really shown maturity in handling the entire issue,” the source said. “This is a great response from her.”
