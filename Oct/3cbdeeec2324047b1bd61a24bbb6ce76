Another dancer has come out to contradict what Kaffy said in her angry Instagram post to further fuel the ensuing drama between her and Davido.
 
Kaffy’s angry Instagram video continues to open more cans of worm.
We’ve definitely not seen or heard the last of the beef between Nigerian dance queen, Kaffy and Davido.
 
Two days ago, in a fiery Instagram video, she called out Davido for treating dancers badly and sending them off stage at the just concluded ‘3 Thrones’ concert in Lagos and even went on to call him a ‘motherfucker’.
 
A few hours later, a new video surfaced online showing Davido performing with dancers on stage at the same event, and the lead choreographer, Micheal Igbelabo of DNMT spoke exclusively to Thenetng saying, ‘Davido never sent dancers off stage‘.

Now, a new Facebook video is going viral where some dancers at a rehearsal led by Micheal Omani called out Kaffy.
 
In the words of Micheal Omani, ‘I disagree with what Kaffy. If you want to throw shades at anybody, do it without involving dancers because the same thing you said Davido did to you is what you do to us and I bet if dancer vote we’ll vote you out that you are wrong. You call dancers for shows, you don’t pay them, you take dancers to Calabar and you leave them there stranded, call dancers to your house and put 50 people in one room and you travel round the world calling yourself queen of dance in Nigeria. A queen takes care of her followers, you don’t take care of us and you are putting us in your beef.’
