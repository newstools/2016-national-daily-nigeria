Federal High Court in Lagos Wednesday heard that a former Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Director-General Dr Patrick Akpobolokemi allegedly rented his Banana Island home for two years with N40million.
An Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), investigator Orji Chukwuma, while testifying in Akpobolokemi’s trial, alleged that the money formed part of proceeds of crime.
Chukwuma, who the prosecution’s 11th witness, said Akpobolokemi allegedly lived far above his means.
He said the defendant, a former lecturer at Niger-Delta University where he earned a little above N100, 000 before he joined NIMASA, had over N154 million in his NIMASA salary account.
Chukwuma said Akpobolokemi paid the N40 million three tranches of N12 million, N14 million and N14 million for 2013 and 2014 rent.
The witness said the former NIMASA chief also paid N38.5 million to Vision Motors for a Toyota Landcruiser Bullet Proof Jeep.
He said Akpolobokemi paid the money in five tranches between November 11, 2011 and June 19, 2013, in addition to a cash payment of N10 million which he said was above the threshold.
Akpobolokemi was charged along with a former Executive Director, Maritime Safety and Shipping Development at NIMASA, Captain Ezekiel Agaba, his aides Ekene Nwakuche and Governor Juan as well as Blockz and Stonz Limited, Kenzo Logistics Limited and Al-Kenzo Logistic Limited.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) accused them of converting N2, 658,957,666 between December 23, 2013 and May 28last year.
They pleaded not guilty.
Justice Ibrahim Buba adjourned until November 26 and 29 for continuation of trial.
