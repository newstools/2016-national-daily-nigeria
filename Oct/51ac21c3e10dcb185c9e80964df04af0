The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says its Maiduguri Zonal office has recovered 196,670,000 naira for the Federal Government.
This is contained in a statement signed by the EFCC Head of Operations in Borno State, Ibrahim Bappa, on Thursday.
According to the statement, 2.8 million naira was also recovered for individual victims as a result of petitions received and acted upon by the zone.
In the statement, the EFCC urged the public to report public officials suspected to have used their position to enrich themselves or individuals living above their means by writing petitions to the office.
The Maiduguri Zonal office, which suspended operations in the heat of insurgency in the northeast, resumed operations in November 2015.
All the recoveries were made upon the resumption.
Meanwhile, the Ibadan Office of EFCC says it has recovered N57.31 million in less than 10 months of its operation.
Mr Wilson Uwujaren, Head of Media and Publicity of EFCC, said in a statement in Abuja that the Ibadan Zonal Office, Oyo State, established in January 2016 was to serve as an impetus to the anti corruption campaign.
“It was also due to the resolve of the acting Executive Chairman, Ibrahim Magu to extend the anti graft war to the grassroots and to bring the commission closer to the people,” he said.
The spokesman said that within a few months of existence, the office had received over 200 petitions, out of which 123 were under investigation.
He urged members of the public and the media to support the efforts of the commission by reporting cases of corruption promptly.
“We will forge ahead and diligently pursue all cases to ensure that justice is served accordingly,” Uwujaren said.
