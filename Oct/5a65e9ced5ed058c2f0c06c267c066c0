The National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI)  said it’s now focusing on the safe return of at least 2 million displaced Nigerians to their homes in what it tagged ‘Operation Back Home’
“We will intensify efforts to rehabilitate victims nationally and empower them in conjunction with local, state and federal governments as well as the international community,” NCFRMI’s commissioner, Sadiya Farouq told the commission’s management in Abuja Wednesday.
“I appeal to you all to join in the ‘Operation Back Home’ (OBH) for Internally Displaced Persons.”
Ms. Farouq said the program will include persons displaced by activities of herdsmen, flood and other disasters and will be centred on ensuring the safety of the territories the displaced persons are meant to return to.
“OBH also includes the Benue, Ekiti, Enugu, Zamfara and other states displaced by herdsmen, flood and sundry disasters.
“We are going to conduct a survey to know who the real IDPs are, know where they are coming from and if it is not safe for them to go back home, we will find a way to make life very comfortable for them for the time being.
“That is what we are going to do because this thing is not something that can be achieved over night. But we will do our best.
“Our plan is to collaborate with all the strategic partners because we all have the same mission. So, we will work hand in hand with all the relevant stakeholders to ensure that the goal is met,” she said.
