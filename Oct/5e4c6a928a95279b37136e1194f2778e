The Naira, however, fell at the official interbank market as it traded at N320 to the dollar, from N311 posted on Monday.
Meanwhile, Harisson Owoh, a BDC operator, said that Travelex was selling 10,000 dollars weekly to each BDC that would be able to fund its account before the stipulated time.
Mr. Owoh said that the sale of forex by Travelex was subject to its availability.
He added that BDCs only sold to their clients above official price, only if the forex at their disposal was sourced from autonomous sources.
