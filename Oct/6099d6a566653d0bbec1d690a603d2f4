Jimoh Ibrahim, the governorship candidate of the Ali Modu Sheriff faction of the PDP, has attacked the Ondo INEC, describing its  Resident Electoral Commissioner Segun Agbaje and others as riggers and bribe-takers.
In an interview with Sunday Punch,  Ibrahim said Agbaje arranged to meet him concerning the November election recently in London when he attended Agbaje’s son graduation ceremony.
“I told him I had no business with him. I am not out to rig the election in Ondo. I don’t want anybody to rig me in,” Ibrahim said.
“I am not saying that he is fraudulent but he arranged a London meeting and I said no. I have a call record of the conversations. How can I go and see the INEC REC in London because I want to be governor in Ondo State?”
Ibrahim has been having problem regularising his candidacy with INEC because he belong to the Ali Modu Sheriff camp.
According to him, the electoral body ought to be an unbiased umpire in the electoral process of the country but added that the corruption within the commission was alarming.
He further claimed that it took him a long time to submit his credentials with the electoral body for documentation after a court judgment.
He added that the electoral body, however, rejected the documents on a pretense that there were errors in the court judgment.
He explained how he met a female official in INEC’s legal department who insisted there was error on the judgement though she had not gone through the documents.
“I was shocked when she demanded $1m from me before she could accept the document. I thought it was a joke. I told her I won’t give out any money,” Ibrahim told the newspaper.
He claimed he is still the  the authentic governorship candidate of the PDP for the November election, adding that he would not step down for Eyitayo Jegede whom Governor Olusegun Mimiko has put forward.
Submission of candidates’ names end October 27.
