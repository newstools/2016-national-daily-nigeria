Olamide and Don Jazzy had a short-lived spat at the last Headies while Davido has said he’ll pull a Kanye at the coming edition if Mayorkun doesn’t get an award.
The last edition of the HEADIES witnessed the ‘Kanye’ moment courtesy of YBNL leader, Olamide.

And Davido has already promised to pull a Kanye at this year’s event if his new signee, Mayorkun doesn’t win the NEXT RATED category.

In an exclusive chat with Thenetng, we asked Hip TV boss, Ayo Animashaun his plans should any artiste attempt a Kanye moment at this year’s event.

In his words, ‘It’s all up to them, we would do what we need to do and where we need to take disciplinary actions, we will. You can’t really stop anybody from doing whatever they want to do or what if the person is under the influence and they do it and regret it the next minute, it’s all up to them but there are consequences for everything we do.’

He also said, ‘You know it’s a big stage, a big platform and everyone is watching, people like to get noticed but you better be careful what you do because it’s not just about getting noticed it’s about how people see you afterwards.’
