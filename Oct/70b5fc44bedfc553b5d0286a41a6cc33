Tragedy was averted on Sunday about 9.00am as troops of Operation LAFIYA DOLE deployed behind Bakassi Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp, Damboa road, Maiduguri, on security duty, intercepted and killed a male suicide bomber.
The bomber had attempted to sneak through the troop’s’ inner parapet towards the IDP camp before he was cut down by an army snipper.
It was learnt that the vigilant sentry sighted the bomber and laid in wait until the suicide bomber came close. The sniper instantly shot and killed the terrorists as he tried to force his way to the western flank of the IDP camp fence.
Unfortunately, the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) vest strapped on the bomber failed to detonate.
National Daily gathered that consequently, a combined team of military and police Explosive Ordinance Device (EOD) have safely recovered the IED for detonation.
Army spokesperson, Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman, who confirmed the averted attack said there was calm at the centre.
