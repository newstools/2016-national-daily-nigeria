The Ekiti State Government on Wednesday, October 5, announced the commencement of the implementation of its Social Welfare Scheme for the needy, aged and unemployed. Under the scheme, 10,000 beneficiaries already shortlisted, would receive N5, 000 each monthly. Gov. Ayo Fayose, who launched the scheme, said beneficiaries cut across various strata of the society.
He said the money was being paid directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. According to the governor, the programme was designed to reduce the financial challenges faced by the beneficiaries. The governor assured that in spite the current economic downturn, his administration would still find ways of helping the downtrodden to enable them live in some level of comfort.
The governor said that the beneficiaries cut across the physically-challenged, the albinos, visually-impaired, the aged, among others. The governor said no fewer than 6,000 beneficiaries had their accounts credited with the money on Wednesday, Oct. 5, the kick-off date. He explained that by directly crediting accounts of beneficiaries, the state was eliminating fraud and ensuring that the real beneficiaries get the money.
