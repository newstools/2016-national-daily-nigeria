The Joint Military Force deployed to the Niger Delta, Operation Delta Safe, says it will not tolerate any attempt by aggrieved communities to shut down oil facilities under any guise.
Joseph Okojie, commander of the joint force, stated this on Wednesday when the Bayelsa Oil and Gas Task Force paid a familiarisation visit to the headquarters of the military outfit in Yenagoa.
Mr. Okojie, a Rear Admiral, who was represented by Kelvin Aligbe, Deputy Commander of the outfit, pledged to collaborate with the Bayelsa Oil and Gas Taskforce to tackle oil theft and pipeline vandalism..
He said that there were established channels of resolving conflict amongst parties in the oil sector and urged communities to abstain from taking the laws into their hands.
He expressed optimism that the partnership would check illegal shutting down of oil facilities and oil theft in the state.
Felix Ayah, Special Adviser to Bayelsa Governor on Oil and Gas, said the Taskforce was to complement the efforts of the security outfit.
Mr. Aya said the Bayelsa Government had inaugurated the Oil and Gas Task Force to support the military in their fight against illegal oil bunkering and illegal shutting down of companies by groups and communities.
He, therefore, urged all aggrieved groups and communities to channel their complaints to his office, so long as the various groups and communities agitations were genuine.
He lauded the joint military operation for its ongoing operations to flush out criminals and restore peace to the Niger Delta region.
