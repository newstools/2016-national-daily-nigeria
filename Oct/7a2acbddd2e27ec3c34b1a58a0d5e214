The Niger Delta Youth Movement (NDYM), Ondo State chapter, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for “rebuilding the country’s lost image.’’
Chairman of NDYM, Agbejoye Adetoye, via a statement issued on Thursday in Abuja, expressed the movement’s appreciation to the president for his efforts at making integrity and discipline the watchwords of Nigerians.
According to him, these values have eluded many of the country’s leaders and citizens over the years.
“It is on record that integrity, discipline and honesty are gradually returning to our public life unlike in the past when impunity was the order of the day.
“The president’s popular slogan, ‘If Nigeria refuses to kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria’ is fast gaining a strong footing in public consciousness.
“The anti-corruption campaign of the present administration has prevented the country from total collapse.
“We are grateful to the president for securing the recent release of 21 Chibok girls. We pray that his dream for a new Nigeria will not be cut short,’’ he said.
Adetoye stated that the movement was satisfied with the recall of erroneous nomination of Adetokunbo Ajasin as the Ondo State representative in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board.
This, he said, was because Ajasin’s nomination was against the NDDC Act 2000 and 2001 as amended.
He appealed to the president to let the voice of Niger Delta youths count in the nomination of another Ondo State representative in the board.
