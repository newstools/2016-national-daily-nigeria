The Coalition of Niger Delta Youth Leaders has appealed to the youths in the Niger Delta Region to embrace peace and give the Federal Government all the needed support to bring peace to the Region.
The appeal was contained in the speech by the Leader of the Youth Coalition, Comrade Emeni Ibe when the group visited the Defence Headquarters.
Comrade Ibe said that the Niger Delta Youth Leaders were in Defence Headquarters to add their voice to many other patriotic citizens of our great nation who were commending the military for subduing terrorism and other vices across the nation.
The Youth group pledged its unflinching support to the amnesty programme of the Federal Government which it noted has helped many youths of the area in the field of training and education with many of erstwhile agitators now economically independent.
The Team Leader called on co-Niger Delta youth comrades to shield their swords and embrace dialogue that would bring lasting peace and development to the Niger Delta Region adding that there can never be any development in the absence of peace.
While thanking the Youth Leaders for the gesture, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Gabriel Olonisakin, who was represented by the Chief of Policy and Plans at Defence Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal Bashir Saidu, said that what Nigeria require at this time is peace to bring about development and to attract foreign investors to our dear nations.
He appealed to other youths in the Niger Delta to emulate the Coalition of Youth Leaders by supporting the effort of government for rapid development in the Niger Delta region.
