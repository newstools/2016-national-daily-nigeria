ALL Progressives Congress (APC) Deputy National Publicity Secretary Comrade Timi Frank yesterday accused the partyâ€™s National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, of running its affairs like a ministry.
He said any attempt to suspend him from the party would have adverse consequences.
Frank accused some members of the APC leadership as well as some members of its National Working Committee of being afraid to speak out even when they allegedly knew that things were not working well within the fold.
Reacting to the setting up of a disciplinary committee to investigate him, Frank said the Odigie-Oyegun seems to have forgotten that he was no longer presiding over a ministry as permanent secretary, who can hire and fire.
Describing the committee as a Kangaroo panel, Frank said suspending him from the party might turn out to be a wasteful venture as it might turn him into the biggest opposition of the party.
He said the party should be careful not to fall into the same trap the African National Congress (ANC) fell into in South Africa, when it suspended one of its leaders, Julius Malema.
He said Malema was fighting impunity within the party.
