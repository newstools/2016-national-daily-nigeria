Samuel “Sam” Owori of Kampala, Uganda was today confirmed president-nominee of Rotary International – a humanitarian service organization that unites leaders committed to improving lives and bringing positive, lasting change to communities around the world.
As a member of the Rotary Club Kampala, Uganda for 38 years, Owori says, “Rotary has become a way of life for me – with the intrinsic value and core belief in mutual responsibility and concern for one another as a cornerstone. I feel immense satisfaction knowing that through Rotary, I’ve helped someone live better.”

During his one-year term as Rotary’s 108th president beginning on 1 July 2018, Owori will focus on building membership worldwide and increasing visibility and understanding of Rotary. He’s played an instrumental role in growing the number of clubs in Uganda from nine to 89 over the course of 29 years. “Today more than ever, the world needs to know and understand Rotary’s impact and values of advancing international understanding, goodwill and peace,” says Owori. “We are all too busy and we’ve lost our patience. Through friendship and service, membership in Rotary offers countless ways to connect and create meaningful change in your community, as well as opportunities to see the world through a more global lens.”
Rotary members throughout the world take action to make communities better.  They contribute their time, energy and passion to carry out impactful and sustainable projects in the areas of peace and conflict resolution, disease prevention and treatment, water and sanitation, maternal and child health, basic education and literacy, and economic and community development.
