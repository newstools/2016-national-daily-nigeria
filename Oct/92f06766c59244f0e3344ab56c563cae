The National Judicial Council (NJC) in its 78th meeting, under the leadership of its Chairman Chief Justice of Nigeria Mahmud Mohammed, recommended justices Mohammed Ladan Tsamiya and Innocent Umezulike for compulsory retirement on Friday.
The NJC also dismissed Justice Kabiru Auta and stated that he be handed over to the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in Kano State for prosecution.
The NJC said that Mr. Umezulike, Enugu’s chief justice, was  sacked for  accepting N10 million in gifts from individuals on whose case he sat, and for  making dishonourable remarks as senior judicial officer, and for abusing his judicial powers in several cases.
: “There have been many instances of abuse of judicial powers by [Mr. Umezulike], particularly against the two defendants in Suits Nos. E/6/2013 and E/88/2016.  The Chief Judge clung to these two suits to remain in his Court, despite all genuine efforts made by the defendants to get the suits transferred to another Court,” a press release by the NJC stated.
