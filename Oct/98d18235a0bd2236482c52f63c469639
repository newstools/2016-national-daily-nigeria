The Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, has said that the Federal Government will spend N30 billion to develop the biggest agro-industrial hub in West Africa.
Ogbeh made the statement on Tuesday when he visited the 15,000 hectares of land to be used for the hub in Kwali Area Council, Federal Capital Territory.
He said that the first phase of the project would focus on improving road network in the area, construction of lakes and dams, soil testing, to enable farmers to know where to grow what.
According to him, some of the monies to be used in the development of the agro hub will come from support fund, levies from certain imports and the private sector.
The minister said that no fewer than 3,000 youths would be engaged in the project which is expected to boost agricultural production.
He listed some agricultural produce to be grown and processed in the farm, to include vegetables for local consumption and exports, rice, soya beans, shea butter.
Ogbeh said that modern abattoirs would also be established in the farm to aid livestock management.
“A time is coming when this business of cattle roaming around will stop and we will not allow anybody move life cows.
“We are looking at spending between 10 to 30 billion naira within the next 3 to 4 years for this massive project; we want young people to subscribe to this project,’’ the minister said.
