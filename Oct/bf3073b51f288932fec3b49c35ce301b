The enlarged national caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party Wednesday rejected the outcome of the Edo State governorship election held last week, describing the exercise as a charade.
Held at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Center, Abuja, the meeting was chaired by the national chairman of the party, Ahmed Makarfi.
A statement signed by a spokesperson of the party, Chinwe Nnorom, said the meeting briefed the national caucus on the status of the party and the ongoing reconciliation process.
“The National Caucus frowned at the brazen display of avarice and desperation against the Edo electorates and democracy on September 28 and 29, 2016 by the ruling APC in collaboration with INEC and security agencies all in the name of Governorship Election,”  statement signed by party’s spokesperson Chinwe Nnorom said.
It also stated that the national caucus had called on all party members nationwide and in Edo State to “remain calm and resilient in the face of this daylight robbery of their mandate to our Candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. We believe that justice will be served”.
Present at the meeting were Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT), Walid Jubrin, Principal Officers of the National Assembly, Governors of Ondo, Taraba, Bayelsa, Gombe.
There were also other members of the National Caretaker Committee, National Vice Chairmen, former Governors, former Ministers, other members of BoT and other members of the National Executive Committee, NEC.
