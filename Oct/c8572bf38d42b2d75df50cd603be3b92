At the election, which held in Pretoria, South Africa, Fowler polled 13 votes ahead of the four secured by his Togolese opponent.
In his acceptance speech on behalf of Nigeria, Fowler pledged to expand the membership of the Forum for the continent’s development.
In his words “Our goal shall be to aid the generation of revenue efficiently and sufficiently for the growth of all members,” Fowler said.
An official of Mauritius was voted Vice-president.
Also elected into the 10 country council were South Africa, Ghana, Burundi, Uganda and Liberia.
