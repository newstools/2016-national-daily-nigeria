The Niger State Command of the Nigeria Immigration Service said on Wednesday that 53 illegal immigrants have been repatriated to Niger Republic.
Mrs Tamuno Oyedeji, Comptroller of Immigration Service in the state disclosed this in an interview with the National Daily in Minna.
Adededji said the state government provided vehicles for the transportation of the illegal immigrants to the border post at Jibia in Katsina state.
“We successfully handed them over to the Niger Republic Immigration officers at the border post,’’ she said.
Adedeji said that the immigrants were repatriated because their presents constitute security threats in the state.
She said that most of the illegal immigrants possess expired documents, while others have no legal documents to back their legitimate stay in the country.
The comptroller said that the command has taken proactive security measures to ensure only immigrants with proper documents are allowed into the country through Babana border with Benin Republic.
