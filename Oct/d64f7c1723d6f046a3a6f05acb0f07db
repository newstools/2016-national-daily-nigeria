The Senate on Wednesday mandated its Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to investigate the purported arrest of six judges by the Department of State Security (DSS).
This followed the request by the committee to invite the judges for clearer insight on the issue.
Chairman of the committee, Sen. David Umaru, had on a point-of-order during plenary said that it was necessary to invite the judges to provide answers to certain questions from the senate.
“By virtue of the 1999 Constitution as amended and Order 96, Rule 37 of our Rules, the powers of this committee to oversight the Judiciary and its powers include judicial matters and judges.
“I am bringing this to the attention of the Senate so that we can take the permission to enable us conduct proper oversight on this matter and invite the justices.
“This is to enable us to interact with them in order to conduct proper oversight as we are enjoined by the provision of our rules and the 1999 Constitution,” he said.
In his response, President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, gave the committee permission to proceed with the oversight function as they had already been empowered by the rules.
“You do not need to come to us; you have your powers under the oversight and you should be able use the powers and do whatever you deem necessary.
“So, do your job in line with your powers,” Saraki said.
Operatives of the DSS had in a sting operation on Oct. 8, arrested six justices who were alleged to be corrupt.
The judges are John Okoro and Sylvester Nguta of the Supreme Court and a former Chief Judge of Enugu State, Innocent Umezulike.
