A 51-year-old Rose Edward has landed in police net for allegedly buying a two-month-old baby for N450,000.
Cordelia Nwanwe, the Akwa Ibom Police Command’s spokesperson, told journalists that a homeopathic doctor, Eneyo Nyang, was arrested in connection with the crime.
He said Ms. Edward, from Rivers, confessed to have bought the baby because she needed a baby of her own.
Confessing to the crime, the mother of the baby, Comfort Effiong, said she sold her baby because there was no one to take care of her.
“I sold the baby because of help; I don’t have anybody to help me. My father is late and my mother is sick and I don’t have anybody to help me,” Ms. Effiong said.
Mr. Mani assured Akwa Ibom people that the command would not relent in its effort to curb crime in the state.
He warned members of the public wishing to adopt children to follow due process.
