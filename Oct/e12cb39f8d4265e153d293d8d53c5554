The Crown Prince of Benin Kingdom, Prince Eheneden Erediauwa, will today visit Use community in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State to choose the name he will answer as the Oba.
Prince Erediauwa, who is staying at the Usama Palace, will leave in the morning. He will be accompanied by a large crowd to Use.
At Use, the Crown Prince will play the Akhue game and announce the name he will answer.
The Crown Prince would not know the name to answer until he plays the game.
Already, Use community is wearing a new look ahead of Prince Erediauwa’s visit.
Many shrines in the community, where some rituals will be performed, have been cleared while the road to the community has been repaired.
The ancient home housing the shrine, where Prince Erediauwa will play the game, has been painted while the residents are in a happy mood.
The shrine’s keeper and Edigin N’Use, Ekpen Kelvin, told reporters that he had been prepared to receive the Crown Prince even though he had not been born in 1979 when Oba Erediauwa visited the shrine.
He said: “ We are in full gear for the coming of our Crown Prince. I was not born in 1979 when the former Crown Prince visited. I will play the traditional game with the Prince.”
