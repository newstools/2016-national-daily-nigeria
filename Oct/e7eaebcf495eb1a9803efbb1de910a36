The State Security Service has released all the judges arrested during a nationwide sweep between Friday and Saturday.
Sources in the agency said all the seven judges were released on self-recognition.
“They were all released on bail yesterday (Sunday) on self recognition”.
“They reported this morning (Monday) and they have all gone back home. They will be coming back tomorrow. And everything went very procedurally well and civil.
“They were released on bail on self recognition based on the fact that given their standing in the society, they cannot run away. They were instructed that they should come back today by 10am.
“They did report for investigation this morning and they have gone back home. And the investigation continues and preparation to charge them to court.”
The crackdown has continued to generate mixed reactions across the country.
