The last five days has seen Nigerian pop stars, Simi and Falz fuel their dating rumours by sharing ‘Pre-wedding’ themed photos on social media daily.

Even though Thenetng has reported that the photos are promo pictures for a new EP the duo are currently working on, a lot of their fans still believe Simi and Falz will walk down the aisle soon.

Since Thenetng’s May 2016 report where we wrote about the love triangle between Adekunle Gold, Simi and Falz, the trio have denied the reports at every turn.

Fresh facts have now emerged that Simi’s five-year relationship with Adekunle Gold is still going as strong as ever.

Just so you know, Simi mixed and mastered Adekunle Gold’s album, if they aren’t cool together will she do it?’
