The Citizens Action To Take Back Nigeria and Coalition of Civil Society mobilised members and hundreds of other Nigerians yesterday, and picketed the National Assembly, asking the Department of State Services to raid the federal lawmakers too.
*“It is time to tell our lawmakers that we voted them in to make laws not to loot our resources. It is time to make them see that power belongs to us and we can wield it at any time,” said Ibrahim Garba Wala, leader of the group.
“We demand accountability and transparency from them and we will not hesitate in confiscating whatever we feel does not represent who we knew they were before they were voted in. Politics cannot be seen as a means of amassing wealth.”
According to him, there are so many people who are in the National Assembly today who have no right whatsoever to be there because they lack even the basic qualities required in law making.
“It is a flawed system, but that change must start somewhere and it is starting today,” he added.
He vowed the protest was going to be a sustained action unless every member of the National Assembly who has stolen Nigeria’s money returns it.
“Where criminal activities were aided and abetted, they should be exposed and prosecuted, or else this campaign will not stop,” Garba said.
“We may be starting with National Assembly today but we will reach every sector until we take back Nigeria.”
