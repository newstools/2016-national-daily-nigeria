In order to thwart surprise attacks from insurgents, the Nigerian Army has commissioned a new operational base in Buratai village in Borno state to provide enabling support and sustain military operation in the north east.
Located along Damaturu-Biu Road, the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, said that the base would also ensure safety at the eastern part of Gombe and north western part of Adamawa State.
The COAS said that, “More Forward Operation Base will be established across the country to support military operations in other parts of the country,” noting that budgetary allocation will be captured in 2017 budget.
At the base are accommodation facilities to personnel and other facilities that would make the base habitable.
Emphasising that the base was strategically located considering that Buratai village links Borno, Yobe, Adamawa and Gombe states, it would support military operations in the fight against Boko Haram terrorists group.
The Commander of Operation Zaman Lafiya Dole, Major General Lucky Irabor, said the aim of siting the operational base in Buratai village was to check the movement of terrorists and transportation of food, and weapons to the insurgents.
The Deputy Governors of Yobe State, Abubakar Aliyu, and his Borno State counterpart praised the military for the foresight, saying it will check the activities of the insurgents along the route.
