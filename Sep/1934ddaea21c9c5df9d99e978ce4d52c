JUMABEE, the young singer who recently released his single “I miss good music” a track that encourages new generation singers to add good content in their songs has come out to defend his decision to sing about improving lyrical content in songs.
The S2DB act who spoke to this writer cleared the air with these words “when i set out to record “I miss good music”, it was not that the guys around are not doing a wonderful jobs. Let’s ask ourselves, how many of our today’s songs will the children of tomorrow be able to remix? Only a few, I am in the system so the song talks to me as well, we just need to work hard on our content else all the efforts we are putting to build this music industry will amount to nothing in the next few years.” The self styled Mr. Good Music submitted.

Meanwhile, the song that featured Sound Sultan, Banky W and Niyola saw ace cinematographer Avalon Okpe, work on the video that Jumabee described as a short film. “The song is not your everyday song, so we decided to shoot a short film for it, to match the people’s expectation, the video will be hitting the airwaves anytime soon because we intend to contribute our quota in changing the way things are done in our music industry.
Meanwhile, the young singer is set to release a new single tagged “amin” in appreciation to God almighty for granting all his wishes”.
