To lift Nigeria out of the current economic hardship, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has called on the Federal Government to take decisive and courageous steps in doing so.
The group has also advised the government not to give up in the war against insurgency until victory is ascertained.
Speaking at a thanksgiving service for the new CAN leadership on Sunday in Abuja, CAN President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, also insisted that government must give deserved attention to the menace of Fulani herdsmen, kidnappers and armed robbery as well as, take definite steps to address all forms of violence in the country.
“Government should know that it is the last resort for the people. Government is the one managing the national purse, so it should courageously address economic challenges confronting the country and not chicken out,” he stated.

While expressing concern over the hardship Nigerians are going through, he encouraged them to “be hopeful and know that the solution is not in going to commit suicide, going into depression, or venting anger on people around them, because these people are not the cause of your problems. The economic downturn is not only in Nigeria, it is in Brazil and other countries of the world, but we want to kick it out of Nigeria and with concerted efforts we will all get there.
“Let us also change our attitude to work, because some people don’t want to work; they just want to while away time. You cannot earn salary when you are not adding value, our attitude to work must change. Hard work is what will lead this nation out of the economic recession we have found ourselves.”
