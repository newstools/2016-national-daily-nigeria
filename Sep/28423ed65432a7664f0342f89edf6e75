President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick has refuted claims in some section of the Nigerian media that the leadership of Confederation of African Football (CAF) rejected his nomination for a seat on the FIFA Council (formerly known as FIFA Executive Committee).
NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, categorically stated that at no time did Pinnick, who is a member of the CAF Organizing Committee for the Africa Cup of Nations, filled form to be considered for CAF nomination for the FIFA Council.
“Although the truth is that Nigeria is big enough as a country to have a member in the esteemed FIFA Council, I want to say without any fear of contradiction that at no time did the NFF President, Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick, filled form for CAF to consider him for nomination.
“It is not an illegitimate ambition for a Nigerian to aspire to be in the FIFA Council. In the future, perhaps Mr. Pinnick or any other worthy Nigerian who is able to receive the support of the Government will approach CAF to be nominated to the Council.”

Sanusi once more called on some sections of the media to cross –check their facts before going public with fallacies.
“This administration has always harped on the fact that it does not abhor criticisms. What we are against is sheer falsehood made to look like facts.
“As it is said in the media, facts are sacred and comments are free. It is important to separate facts from opinion.”
It is worth noting that the elections into the FIFA Council are slated for September 29 with seven possible candidates already announced by CAF: Almamy Kabele Camara (Guinea), Suketu Patel (Sychelles), Kwesi Nyantakyi (Ghana), Ahmad (Madagascar), Augustin Senghor (Senegal, Hamidou Djibrilla (Niger) and Chabur Goc Alei (South Sudan).
