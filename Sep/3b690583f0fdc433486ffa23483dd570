The media office of APC leader, Bola Tinubu, has come out to repudiate newspaper and social media headlines suggesting that the former Lagos State Governor is at war with leaders of the ruling party.
In a disclaimer released September 27, Tinubu’s media managers insist the framing of the supposed friction was untrue and unfounded.
“In the past 48 hours, we have noticed the churning out of falacious and outright malicious stories in the social media concerning Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.”
“We want to state that the stories are patently false and we urge unsuspecting Nigerians to ignore the lies being spread and the wicked stories about what Tinubu purportedly said or did. The stories being churned out are being done by some fifth columnists who seek to drive a wedge between these leaders.”

“One of such stories is the one entitled ‘Tinubu Bombs Buhari,’ which is fit only for the trash can and a figment of the writer’s imagination.”
“Asiwaju Tinubu remains a staunch APC stalwart and supporter of the APC government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu is preoccupied with assisting to find solutions to the present challenges now confronting us as a nation and nothing will distract him from doing this.”
However, the disclaimer was silent over the reported friction between Tinubu and National Chairman of the APC, John Odigie Oyegun.
