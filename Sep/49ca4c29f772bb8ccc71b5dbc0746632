Barely two months left to perfect search for a good replacement for deceased (Dr)  Elijah Adewale, the Federal  House of Representatives member representing Ifako/Ijaye federal  constituency, concerned youths there have stated their resolve to hinder all forms of alleged imposition attempt at the upcoming bye-election for JAH’s replacement.
Youth under the aegies  of Ifako/Ijaye Youth Action for Good Governance (IYAGG) has warned the leadership of the party against imposition of candidate,noting that this will be largely inimical to the well being of the constituents and constituency in particular,”this will be vehemently resisted”.
In a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary,Comrade Niyi Adelaja,made available to our correspondent,the youth group said it has been hearing rumour that certain senator from another state through his governor is trying to force an unpopular candidate who has contested for house of assembly and failed three times, on them.
According to the statement,”we are aware of all the intrigues ,bickering and political subterfuges currently going on, to impose on us an inconsistent politician that sees politics more or less like a  gamble or lucky deep,where you try your luck and if it doesn’t work you disappear from the political scene until there is another chance again.

We want to sound a note of warning to all the persons behind this bickering against the good people of Ifako/Ijaye constituency,that this will not work because we are different from Alimosho people who will allow external influence prevail when it comes to choosing who represents them.
Therefore,we advise the governor in question to face his state and leave us the people of Ifako/Ijaye alone to choose who represent us,because we don’t want a representative who will put the interest of his godfather before that of the constituents,which will be the case if allowed to choose for us.
We are using this opportunity to reach out to the national leader of our great party (APC)  Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to in the interest of our people and our party, quickly call the governor to order as the people of Ifako/Ijaye are ready to do anything to ensure nobody no matter how highly placed subvert democratic process and procedure here,by foisting on us an unsung individual with no record of positive impact on the lives of the poeple of Ifako/ Ijaye since he has been contesting elections.”
Let it be known to everyone that we are already mobilising ourselves using our demographic advantage and numerical strength to determine  our fate at the proposed bye-election, going by the outcome of the 2015 general elections,any reasonable politician should have learnt that the people cannot be taken for granted again.
Once again,we commiserate with the family of late (Dr) Elijah Adewale on this unfortunate incident and we pray that almighty God grant him eternal rest.
