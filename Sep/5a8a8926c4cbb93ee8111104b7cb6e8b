THIS past weekend had the long awaited Buckwyld ‘n’ Breathless concert, as headlined by 2face Idibia and M.I Abaga, go down in style at Eko Hotel, Lagos.
2face Idibia, an accomplished singer-performer, and M.I. Abaga, a disruptive and distinguished rapper, along with a set of carefully selected colleagues including Sound Sultan, Waje, Vector, Ice Prince, Vanessa Mdee and others entertained their fans in a concert that didn’t fall short of predictions to set new records. The stars had rehearsed for weeks ahead of the concert, with music producer, Don L37 spearheading the music and sound direction. Tickets for the event were sold at N5,000 for regular and N30,000 for VIP. Indeed, to create a unique experience for the audience, there were no table tickets on sale. The concert was put together by Buckwyld Media Network and Partners.
