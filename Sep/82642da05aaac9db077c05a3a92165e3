Share turnover is a measure of stock liquidity calculated by dividing the total number of shares traded over a period by the average number of shares outstanding for the period. Thus, the lower the share turnover, the less liquid the shares of companies quoted on the Exchange and vice versa.
To this end, the President and Chairman, Governing Council of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers, Mr. Oluwaseyi Abe, the direction of the capital market at any given time was a reflection of the economy and “it’s been known that the economy has not been doing too well lately. In this regard, it is even the best time to invest in the capital market because once the economy gets better, the capital market will recover as well.”
Some of the factors that draw investors into the capital market, according to him, are positive expectation about the economy; adequate and positive information about the market; security of investment; good returns in the form of dividends and / or capital gains, and favourable government policies.
