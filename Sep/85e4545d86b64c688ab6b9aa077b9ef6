”You should open your eyes wide now. We said it that time, yet people voted for them. See what they are doing to Nigerians in the last one year. We have seen nothing,” Mimiko said.

“We should not allow APC’s ‘change’ in Ondo State. I will not say much, but it is what all of us can see in their government. So, there is no way for APC in Ondo State,” he maintained.

He said his administration had done a lot in the area of poverty alleviation and creation of wealth by distributing loans to traders and artisans in the state.

Mimiko also disclosed that his administration, since inception, had disbursed a sum N1.5 billion to traders and artisans as loans in order to boost small and medium scale enterprises in the state.
