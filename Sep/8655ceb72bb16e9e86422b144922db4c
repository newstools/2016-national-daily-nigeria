Diamond Bank has reinforced its business strategy and also strengthened its firm position as one of Nigeria’s biggest financial institutions with world-class customer service delivery.
In a statement, its Chief Executive Officer, Uzoma Dozie said although the industry is going through numerous challenges, Diamond Bank would exceed shareholders’ expectation at the end of its current business year.
He said the bank is continually on the lookout to optimize new opportunities for growth presented by these realities with the deployment of cutting edge digital mobile technology.
“We are aware that the future of banking is digital and Diamond Bank is recognised for its innovative value added solutions that have changed the banking system to suit the customer lifestyle. These include Diamond Mobile App, Diamond Y’ello Account, Diamond Xclusive and Beta Proposition.”

Some of the technology have aided the reduction of cash cycle and consolidated its hold on the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)) segment, while growing its corporate market. These, it said, have helped in expanding its local market share and deepened its global reach.
To align with current business realities and point the future direction of its service delivery, Diamond Bank also refreshed and renamed some of its financial products.
“Our growth drive begins from the inside as we have put in place a human capacity development system that ensures that we attract the best people in the business, train them to be able to perform at the best level in their jobs and motivate them well enough to stay with us.
According to the CEO, the bank recognises the place of MSMEs as the engine that catalysis economic production and therefore, will continue to deepen the market segment by improving MSMEs stakeholders’ access to funds, market and advisory services.
