Urges him to relinquish power




A former governor of Jigawa State and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stalwart, Alhaji Sule Lamido, has flayed President Muhammadu Buhari for blaming the hardship suffered by Nigerians on recession.
Lamido said at the weekend that there were basic needs of living, which must be provided for the citizens, whatever the harshness of the sweeping recession sequel to the global oil-price crash, maintaining that it was too escapist on the part of the president to blame his inability to source for funds to provide such needs on resession.
“President Buhari is simply incompetent on the provision of the welfare of the citizens because he was never ready for the job, and so, he lacks the capacity to source for the wherewithal to do it well to the satisfaction of Nigerians,” Lamido said.

According to him, “If he (Buhari) cannot ensure the provision of basic needs of Nigerians, tell him to hand over to me and see how I will source for the wherewithal to do it.”
The PDP chieftain drew an analogy: “Imagine a husband who, before marrying his wife, promised her that he would provide all her legal and legitimate needs according to the obligations of matrimony, only to confront the wife shortly after the wedding and tell her that he didn’t know that he would have to provide her ‘this’, and he has now realized that he cannot, and she should please bear with him; and the wife, because of the love she has for him, overlooks that limitation.
“The following day, he confronts her again, explaining his inability to provide another basic need, pleading with her to overlook it, and she does so; again he comes to her another day to say he didn’t know that he also has to provide so and so to her, and now he has realized he cannot; it should dawn on the wife that he simply cannot discharge the obligations of matrimony to her, and it is legal and legitimate for her to seek divorce,” he said.
