THE wife of the Chief of Army Staff, Mrs Umma Kalsum Tukur Buratai has fulfilled her promise to give a facelift to the structures at the Nigerian Army Officers’ Wives Association (NAOWA), Model Nursery and Primary School at the Ojo Military cantonment, Lagos.
Before now, due to the porosity of the school, especially as the fence was dilapidated, school properties were vandalised as criminals wreaked havoc on the entire facilities.
During her recent visit to the NAOWA Model Nursery and Primary School Ojo, Mrs Buratai promised to assist the Parent’s Teachers Association (PTA) to provide needed facilities.
Briefing the NAOWA President, the PTA Chairperson, Mrs Florence Adesina, intimated her of what they have done in the past in the area of facilities in the school. As a result of the dilapidated infrastructure, Mrs Buratai approved the renovation after her visit.
Established in 1985, with five blocks of classrooms and an office for the headteacher, the school became a shadow of itself as roof, ceiling, pupils’ desk and chairs and the school fence broke down, giving room to miscreants to take advantage to further vandalise the school properties.

She emphasised the provision of resources to commence work immediately during the school’s long vacation.
It was also gathered that other infrastructure that are not presently there like the library, computer room, sick bay, security house, floor tiles for classes, fans are being included in the project.
Based on the on-going project, the PTA commended Mrs Buratai for her initiative and providing needed resources to embark on the renovation in order to protect the school properties.
