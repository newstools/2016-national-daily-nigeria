The NIMASA boss, who also acknowledged the International Co-operation Unit of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), disclosed that the training was predicated on the premise that a fact finding team was in Nigerian earlier in the year to conduct a needs- assessment where a number of gaps were identified, which according to him necessitated the training, with a view to addressing some of the gaps identified.
“I am sure that in the course of this exercise, you have learned that good security requires planning and stringent implementation. I know that in the course of this training, the seed of co-operation and collaboration between NIMASA as Designated Authority (DA) for ISPS Code Implementation in Nigeria, and our sister Agencies such as Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Nigerian Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) and the Federal Ministry of Transportation has been planted.”
He stressed that the agency’s total commitment to improving the fortunes of Nigeria by creating an enabling environment for a business friendly and secured environment, for both the local and international stakeholders.
