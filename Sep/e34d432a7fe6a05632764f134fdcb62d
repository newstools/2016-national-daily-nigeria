Following IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu’s petition to the National Judicial Council over allegations of judicial rascality, Justice John Tsoho of the Federal High Court Abuja has stepped down from the trial of the Biafra secessionist.
Tsoho announced he had stepped down September 26 pending the decision of the council.
“Even if I am cleared of any bias by the NJC, I will not continue with this case,” he said.
In the petition sent September 25, Kanu asked the NJC to investigate Tsoho for giving parallel judgements in the course of the treason trial of the defendant who has been in detention since October 2015.

The first judge so accused is Justice Ahmed Mohammed who stepped down last December after Kanu said he had no confidence in him.
Kanu’s lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor,  said Tsoho decided in favour of the defence in an application for the protection of witnesses by the prosecution, and later ruled in favour of the prosecution, without seeking the permission of a higher court.
As the trial opened Monday, Chuks Muoma, another counsel to  Kanu, said Tsoho still sitting on that case amounted to a great disservice because there was a petition against the judge before the NJC.
